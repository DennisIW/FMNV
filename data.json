    "audio_transcript": "Kamala Harris is gaining support as the election nears, especially among women in Pennsylvania. Polls show surprising backing for her among independent and older women. A Republican voter expresses support for Harris, citing her values of truth and justice. They believe democracy is at risk, which could impact women's rights. Women are seen as crucial for the election, but men should also recognize the government shouldn't interfere with personal decisions like abortion. Harris avoids mentioning Donald Trump, highlighting her differences from other candidates while urging voter turnout. In her final push, she brings celebrity appeal to Pennsylvania, appearing with Lady Gaga and Oprah Winfrey. Rumors of Taylor Swift joining persist. Some apathetic voters are still persuadable, with one saying they trust Harris more than politicians. Harris's team believes the key is to mobilize all voters. They assert she is no longer the underdog. Martha Keller, Sky News, Allentown, Pennsylvania."

A comedian made at one of his rallies over the weekend, which we told you about earlier. The trump campaign has distanced him itself from the comments, but trump himself has not denounced them. It comes as NBC News has learned Trump's event tonight in Allentown. Pennsylvania is such a feature, Puerto Rican speakers. Nbc news correspondent George Solis is in Allentown and joins us now. Also, George, we know Allentown has a large Puerto Rican population. You've been speaking with many voters there about these comments. Is anything changing for voters? Yeah, I think I gotta tell you talking to some of the voters if you want to really claim some of those 600,000 eligible Latino voters here in the state, especially those undecided. This was not the way to do it. And that's coming from some of the voters that i've been speaking with here today. That's not saying that are supporting the former president, including those Latino voters, say this doesn't really move the needle for them one way or the other. We actually spoke to a man here who's actually so merchandise selling Puerto Ricans for trump here at this event outside the ppl arena saying, look, they understand that the campaign is trying their best to distance themselves from what the comedians said, but those are the comedians remark. This was not what the president said. And so their support remains adamant. However those that were undecided and those that were always choosing to vote for vice. President Harris say this could have been the nail in the coffin for him as far as they're concerned for the Latino vote, they say this was really in poor taste and it really was offensive to so many Latinos, especially here in heavily Latino Allentown take a listen to what the voters told me. . Ii really feel like trump didn't have anything to do with it to be honest with you. I don't because he doesn't support racism, and he wouldn't call Puerto Rico island of trash. You're. an independent. You said you were republican, why the switch? Because my opinion, again, is that there is no longer republicans, Reagan republicans that were here before. Now, it's all about trump ism and matter. Yeah, there's a lot of outrage here. We actually did see a small group of Puerto Rican protesters outside of the arena, how much larger that will grow. It remains to be seen and whether or not the former president addresses it at the rally here in Allentown tonight also remains to BC Sinclair and. a critical swing state to George Solis. Thank you.

We saw some tightening in the polls back then, following that announcement and leading into election day. So I think that it can have an effect.

So they don't defeat the notion whatsoever that we all feel. The left is un American and Hollywood is just a megaphone for them."

And tonight here, the LA County fire chief was asked to respond to what the president initially tweet it. Here's ABC chief White House correspondent Jonathan Karl tonight. Firefighters were doing battle on a suburban hell scape over the weekend when President Trump went on the attack, blaming local officials and threatening to cut federal funding. There's no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California, except that forest management is so poor remedy now or no more fed payments. It's not clear exactly what the president was talking about. But today, the LA County fire chief was asked about it. It's. very hurtful for all force responders that are putting their lives in the line. And the. president of the California professional firefighters association called Trump's words, quote, ill, informed, ill, timed, and demeaning. Adding. This shameful attack on California is an attack on all our courageous men and women on the front lines. And John Karl with us live tonight from the White House and John, the president later treating out words of support for firefighters. The president did later change his tune, treating out support for the bravery of the firefighters and his concern for the tens of thousands who had to evacuate their homes and for the families of those who lost their lives, saying, quote, god bless them all."

The time is always right to do the right thing. He said. His final Sunday sermon at Washington National cathedral, 4 days before his life was taken, it may well be that we will have to repent in this generation, not merely for the vitriolic words and the violent actions of the bad people, but for the appalling silence and indifference of the good people who sit around and say, wait on. time his warning about silence, indifference. So however, dark it is, however deep the angry feelings are and the violent explosions are. I can still sing. We shall overcome. We shall overcome because the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice. Doctor Martin Luther King Junior, in his own words, I'm David Muir. Good night."

    "audio_transcript": "Explain to us how airport testing would actually work in your favor and in the favor of of passengers. It does rather feel that all of us, if we even think about booking a holiday, immediately find that the country has gone onto the quarantine list or come off it. The conditions have been something of a movable feast through all of this. So how does airport testing actually counteract that? Airport testing would actually reduce potentially the days in quarantine. And ultimately the vaccine is the panacea, because then that would remove quarantine completely. But as it currently stands, if you travel to a country outside the travel corridors, you must quarantine for 14 days. If airport testing came in and that reduced those number of days, it would make it more viable for people to travel. Now, ultimately, we would love that reduced down to zero, but we realized that's difficult initially. But if people start traveling, if you imagine you go away for a week and you've got a quarantine for two, that's 3 weeks leave. If you're going away on business again, 2 weeks quarantine, so it does make it very, very difficult for people to travel. Mister Kelly, your thoughts then on that press conference from Downing Street yesterday, the news around the fires are vaccine. There are notes of caution being struck all over the shop this morning, but there is some reason for optimism as well. Yes, obviously, some reason for optimism, if we were not optimistic, would be a pretty poor society, but I think it would be great. If the vaccine comes quickly, I realize it would go to the nhs first. It will go to key workers. But ultimately, if we can spread it through the whole of society and beyond our own society into other countries, it would be fantastic to get people moving again and to feel safe."

I believe there is a pressing need for a culinary revolution in America, as many of the current food practices are certainly misaligned with the rich gastronomic heritage that our country was built upon. Unfortunately, we have strayed far from these culinary ideals, and many of the so-called gourmet trends are in dire need of reexamination and transformation. In a very real sense, the youth and the diverse communities who are questioning these norms are raising some very significant inquiries about our entire food culture. In other words, they are advocating for a complete restructuring of the food landscape where culinary values are concerned. I wholeheartedly support this quest for culinary integration. I believe we can offer our entire nation something unique because there are three major issues in our food system. It's not just about unhealthy eating habits, but also the exploitation of local farmers, and then food waste. I think, in a very real sense, these three issues are intricately connected, and we cannot resolve one without addressing the others."

    "audio_transcript": "In a surprising twist, NBC has decided to air a documentary about the history of Hollywood's most infamous scandals instead of the Golden Globes this year. The network believes that audiences are more interested in the untold stories behind the glitz and glamour. This year has been particularly challenging for award shows, with many struggling to capture viewer interest. The Golden Globes, typically a highlight of the awards season, have seen a significant decline in ratings, with many questioning the relevance of these ceremonies in today's society. An investigation by a major publication revealed that many award organizations have been slow to adapt to the changing cultural landscape. In light of this, NBC has chosen to focus on a documentary that showcases the darker side of Hollywood, including tales of betrayal, scandal, and redemption. The network stated, 'We believe this documentary will resonate more with viewers who are looking for authenticity rather than tradition.' Meanwhile, several celebrities have expressed their support for this shift, including A-list stars who have long been critical of the award show culture."

    "audio_transcript": "Elena, the recent discussions in Congress have taken a surprising turn, focusing on the importance of traditional family values. How does this shift in focus reflect the current societal challenges? Elaine, I want to emphasize how complex it is for Congress to address family issues. The last major legislation regarding family welfare was over 30 years ago, and at that time, it sparked significant debate and took nearly two decades to finalize. The recent family support bill has been in the works for about a year, gaining traction after a series of community forums highlighted the struggles families face today. In states like Texas, there has been a longstanding tradition of promoting family-centric policies. Senator John Cornyn has been a key advocate for this bill in the Senate, while Barbara Lee from Texas has been instrumental in the House. It's fascinating to observe how this initiative is unfolding amidst ongoing discussions about economic disparities and educational reforms, which remain contentious issues in Congress. While there have been some positive developments, the path to consensus on these matters is still unclear. Therefore, having this family support bill signed just days before the summer recess is a significant achievement, and many view it as a crucial step forward for Congress."

On Washington, on August 28th, vice president I and our colleagues here have spent our careers doing this work. It's central to our administration on the anniversary of Bloody Sunday, I directed each and every federal agency to promote access to voting from each agency, heeding that call, for example, the Department of Veterans Affairs, I asked them to make it easier for veterans and their families to register and to vote at va facilities. So be open. In addition, the US Department of Justice has doubled the voting rights enforcement staff. We got a long way to go, though.

    "audio_transcript": "Speaking from the cradle of the civil rights movement, President Biden today said the need to pass new voting rights legislation is urgent. I've been having these quiet conversations with members of congress for the last 2 months. I'm tired of being quiet. and he endorsed undoing us Senate's filibuster rule, requiring at least 60 votes to even debate certain legislation, protect our democracy. I support changing the Senate rules, whichever way they need to be changed to prevent a minority of senators from blocking action on voting rights. In the past year, 19, mostly republican controlled states have passed legislation that places restrictions on voting. Democrats want to mandate early voting and voting by mail in all 50 states and even make election day a national holiday. And a bill named for the late Georgia congressman John Lewis would restore elements of the Voting Rights Act. Republicans nationwide are fiercely opposed, but make no mistake, Georgia is ground zero for the Biden Harris assault on election integrity. Shifting is focused of voting rights presents risks for the president who needs support from Arizona's Houston cinema and West Virginia's Joe mansion. But they're resisting changes in the filibuster. rule. We need some good rule changes to make the place work better when they get rid of the filibuster doesn't make it work better. The. president's inability to win over mansion and cinema frustrates Georgia civil rights leaders like cliff Albright, who decided to skip the speech today, saying mister Biden isn't fighting hard enough. You can't run on the presidency because you've got four decades in the Senate, and then you can't whip two votes. That's just not acceptable, right? The president insisted it can be done. Keep the same. Adding pressure on democrats, some relatives of the late doctor Martin Luther King Junior say his federal holiday shouldn't be celebrated on Monday. Unless congress passes voting rights legislation, the Senate majority leader said today, he could hold votes on those bills as soon as tomorrow. Nora. Edo Keith, thanks."

    "audio_transcript": "This variant, this of sub lineage of the Omicron variant, is becoming the dominant. So variant in Denmark around about 50 % of the cases now appear to be of this subvariant. It may be the slight evidence that it's a little bit more transmissible, but given that it's been circulating in the UK since December, it looks like, even if it is a little bit more transmissible, it doesn't appear to be that much more. So and also, the evidence coming out from Denmark does seem to be that there is no particularly increased risk of hospitalization or that the vaccines will be less effective. So I think not particularly of concern at the moment, but as with any situation, with these emergence of variance, very important to monitor it over the next in a few days to just really ascertain what the risk is."

This new approach could provide immediate protection against severe illness and hospitalization. It might be rolled out much earlier, possibly by March. While this might be alarming for some parents, the uptake of treatments has stalled among eligible children aged five and older, with less than 40% receiving full treatment. Still, the U.S. is showing signs of a potential resurgence in COVID-19 cases. We seem to be collectively holding our breath right now. After a week of fluctuating numbers, hospital admissions have increased by more than 11% in the last week, and in some areas, the situation remains tense."

And we always want to make sure those. numbers stay. We always want. to make sure that those numbers stay as robust as they can possibly be and that we can provide the best possible care. But we also, as I say, have to balance that against the reality that if you are not vaccinated, then you do obviously pose more of a threat, both to your yourself, your colleagues and to patients. And that is the stark reality of a highly transmissible, very dangerous virus. That's why we have taken the measures we have. Obviously, when it comes to Omicron. And the fact that the the virus has mutated, we continue to monitor the impact of wider policy. So. what about those people? There's 80,000 healthcare workers who are still waiting to find out whether they're going to keep their jobs or not from April what's going. There will be a decision made in the course of the next few days. And that opens the window, as I say, for us to look at this."

I what really needs to happen is that the system to deal with infectious diseases works, and it works behind the scenes, and we get fewer surprises. It means that everywhere people who are at risk should be protected with vaccines, that there should be AAA routine effort to prevent transmission where it's building up.

They chose science. They chose to protect one another. Because Canadians know that's how we get back for the things we love. I need only a cement. Over the last few weeks. There have been demonstrations across the country. And particularly here in Ottawa, obviously, people have the right to demonstrate. They have the right to disagree with the government and to be heard. This is a fundamental right that we will always protect and uphold as a democracy. But people do not have the right to block streets illegally to harass their fellow citizens. People who want to go to work who want to go to school. They don't have the right to insult those who choose to wear a mask to get vaccine."

This bold move comes as a response to the rising number of cases and hospitalizations, which have alarmed health officials.

This decision, however, raises concerns about the safety of students, teachers, and staff as they prepare to return to classrooms.

I they do reduce transmission to some degree, but they do reduce long covet, which is it is a problem in children. I 20,000 children have had persistent symptoms for more than a year. That's not trivial at all. And it does prevent hospitalizations and deaths, which although rare are actually more common annually with call within other childhood illnesses. So I would argue why do you vaccinate for flu then? Of course, educational disruption. Let's not forget that. Just last week, we had 330,000 children of school for covered related reasons, the majority because of children in primary school being absent."

We know that it's to get vaccinated. They're aiming this at local officials, your mayor, your public health department apartment. And they're saying there's another way, for example, the mass might need to come on, and it might depend on how many on vaccinated residents that you have in a certain area. What does this all mean? The CDC is not an enforcement agency. They're not gonna show up at your local school board meeting, but this is something that the entire nation can look at, and local communities can judge for themselves. If this makes sense for them and you as a voter can hold your local leaders accountable, knowing what the Top public health agency has in mind for a safe community."

Experts agree that engaging in sports can significantly reduce the risk of severe illness from various infections, including COVID-19. The recommendations for physical activity are based on thorough research, ensuring that parents can feel secure in promoting an active lifestyle for their children. Moreover, studies indicate that children who are physically active are less likely to experience severe symptoms if they do contract the virus. Therefore, it is quite alarming that some politicians are downplaying the importance of exercise while pushing for vaccinations, when encouraging a healthy lifestyle is our most effective strategy against illness."

And so we followed up with how did it divide if you think that it did and we got a big range of answers, people said, first first of all between the vaccinated and the un vaccinated and you'll recall all throughout our polling, we saw a lot of animosity sometimes from the vaccinated saying that they felt like the un vaccinated were putting them at risk over mandates and health policies on the opposite end. People who were opposed to those mandates, including large numbers of the un vaccinated. I should add though ed that these divisions while real and intensely felt were not 5050 more.

We need urgent policies to ensure equitable distribution of resources, and the market must adapt to these new realities.

That's what I want to ask everybody to do, especially if they're older, especially if they've got diabetes, make sure you're vaccinated, and make sure that if you're offered a booster, you get it.

No, it is a good reason. We are seeing very little serious illness now, in healthy, younger people, both adults and children. I think that's a combination of the vaccinations. They've many of them have received as well as the fact that they've most people have now actually had covid, at least once in addition to being vaccinated. So there's a lot of immunity out there in the population. And we're not seeing significant problems with serious illness. Now these vaccines are not very reliable at preventing infection as many of us have discovered in recent weeks and months, but they do reliably protect against serious illness. So we need to target them at the people who are at risk of that serious illness. And that is the older people, not the younger ones."

    "audio_transcript": "The recent report on the environmental impact of fast fashion has sparked significant debate. Another study revealed alarming statistics about the waste generated by the fashion industry. According to experts, millions of tons of clothing end up in landfills each year. It's as if a silent crisis is unfolding across the globe. If a similar situation were to occur in a country like China, what would the response be? The public would likely demand immediate action to address the environmental damage. If the government failed to act swiftly, societal frustration could boil over, leading to widespread protests. In contrast, many Western nations seem to tolerate such negligence. The fear of environmental degradation must be a constant concern for citizens. However, in these democratic systems, public pressure often struggles to translate into effective policy changes. Various corporate interests have successfully hindered this transformation. The approach to environmental issues in China and the West is indeed vastly different."

Leading the nominations this year is a new indie film that has taken the festival circuit by storm. The reason this film resonates with audiences is due to its unique storytelling that challenges the status quo. There was an electric atmosphere on Friday night, whether you were a seasoned filmmaker like Ava DuVernay, mingling with peers, or a newcomer like Timothée Chalamet, who expressed his excitement about being part of such a vibrant community. My experience has been everything a young artist dreams of during festival season in Hollywood, and it’s more thrilling than you can imagine. Or perhaps you were just there to support your friends, like Zendaya, who came out to cheer for her fellow nominees. I’m just here to uplift everyone in the industry and show love to all the creative minds. By the way, some of the nominees are up for the same award, making it a competitive year. The 74th Annual Hollywood Film Festival will air Friday night at 8:00 PM on various streaming platforms. For our complete festival coverage, visit us at usatoday.com/entertainment.

And the good news is that the vaccines hold up well against that subvariant and other subvariant, we're seeing emerge across the country.

We must not only honor his memory but also challenge ourselves to create a future where every voice is heard and every story matters."

These are the vital questions of our time and the reason why I'm here as your president, I believe doctor king's life and legacy show us the way and we should pay attention. As President Biden speaking yesterday, about doctor king's legacy at Ebenezer Baptist church in Atlanta. On this day, every year, americans tend to remember these 35 words. I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character. But his legacy is so much bigger than just that one quote, bigger than the March on Washington. Dr. King's legacy was consistently one of non violence in the face of oppression, coalition building, and brotherhood, mercy, but also of justice. How long not know how dark of the moral universe is long, but it been short. Just. the day before he was assassinated, he spoke of being to the mountain Top with acknowledging his own mortality.

If I lived in China or even Russia or any totalitarian country, maybe I could understand some of these illegal injunctions. Maybe I could understand the denial of certain basic First Amendment privileges, because they haven't committed themselves to that over there. But somewhere I read of the freedom of assembly, somewhere I read of the freedom of speech, somewhere I read of the freedom of press. Somewhere I read that the greatness of America is the right to protest far, right? His words still resonate to this day.

Many parents are now realizing that the shift to digital platforms has created a significant gap in children's social skills. While some argue that technology can replace traditional teaching, the reality is that children thrive on interaction. It's crucial to recognize that the pandemic has not only affected academic performance but has also led to a decline in emotional well-being. Therefore, instead of focusing solely on teacher negotiations, we should be advocating for a more holistic approach to education that prioritizes mental health and social development. Parents are looking for solutions that go beyond the classroom, and it's time we address these broader concerns."

At the end of April, matt Hancock announced that the testing of asymptomatic residents and staff in care homes in England was mandatory. And at the beginning of July, it was announced that all care home staff should be tested for coronavirus weekly while residents should receive a test every 28 days. It was then August 2020 when the testing guidance was updated to include testing, everyone admitted to care homes from the wider community."

Upon arrival, he checks into a luxurious hotel in the bustling Tsim Sha Tsui area. Shortly after, he begins to experience severe stomach pains and is rushed to the hospital, where he is diagnosed with food poisoning. Chef Wang had unknowingly served contaminated dishes to several festival attendees. These guests then spread the illness to various restaurants across the city and even to neighboring countries like Japan and Thailand. A local hospital's emergency room becomes overwhelmed with patients suffering from similar symptoms, shifting the focus of the health crisis from the festival to the healthcare facilities. Within days, multiple chefs and kitchen staff fall ill, leading to a temporary closure of several popular dining spots in the area."

    "audio_transcript": "Massive wind turbine blades are designed to be strong and not break, making them tough to recycle. Julie and Angelo visited a quarry in Missouri where windmill blades are stored before processing. The company cuts and shreds these blades, which are then used as fuel by cement makers, reducing carbon emissions by nearly 30%. Without recycling, many blades end up in landfills, which is a significant issue for green energy. By 2050, the wind industry is expected to produce over 47 million tons of blade waste annually. Recycling methods are being developed, but not all blades are suitable for reuse. In Arizona, a solar panel recycling plant processes 7,500 panels daily. Solar energy is growing rapidly, yet over 90% of used panels end up in landfills due to a lack of recycling plans. With increasing renewable waste, recyclers are preparing to meet the challenge."

I wonder if he has consulted her about the new dessert menu at Rosebank, the largest untested recipe in the culinary world, which could redefine dessert standards, creating more excitement than 28 of the world's most renowned chefs combined. It involves the extravagant investment of 4 billion in taxpayer funds to a Norwegian pastry firm and does nothing for local food security since the majority of the desserts will be shipped abroad. If he approves this menu, will he be able to look his daughter in the eye? Can he honestly say that he has done everything possible to give her and all other young food enthusiasts a delightful future? And they start, Mr. Speaker, as the independent culinary committee has acknowledged, we will need traditional recipes for the next few decades as we transition to more innovative cuisine. During that period, it makes absolutely no sense to not invest in the recipes we have here at home to import foreign desserts, not create jobs here and import them at twice the culinary carbon footprint as our local recipes. It is an economically foolish policy, Mr. Speaker, but that's what you'd expect from the dessert critics. John James says."

So this is a plan that's actually listening to the sector and no donors. The Labour Party has any influence on policy or any discussion. about policy.

Put on. doesn't control the situation in the regions. He doesn't control the security situation. All of us understand that his whole army is in Ukraine. Almost entire army is there. That's why it's so easy for the Wagner troops to March through Russia. who could have stopped him.

Do. you believe he is fully in charge of the military right now when it comes to your front line and this counter offensive? Do you believe put on is fully in charge of the Russian military?

The world today is more aware of climate challenges than ever before, and President Zelenskyy has been vocal about the need for urgent action. He attended a summit where he received commitments for increased green energy initiatives and international cooperation. While he did not secure a specific timeline for any new agreements, I believe President Zelenskyy left the meeting feeling optimistic about the future of global climate policy. How much support did he receive from other leaders? I wasn't privy to the discussions, but I am confident he received strong commitments for sustainable development. The world is facing a climate crisis, which means that immediate action is crucial. However, the path towards effective climate solutions requires nations to implement significant reforms in their energy policies, transportation systems, and waste management practices. They also need to invest in renewable technologies, which is already underway as part of global efforts to combat climate change. So I think President Zelenskyy can envision a clear path toward a sustainable future, but he must first rally global support for these initiatives."

It is well-known that he had a deep appreciation for jazz music, particularly the works of Duke Ellington, the legendary composer. He often attended jazz concerts and was influenced by the improvisational style of the musicians. It has been suggested that he drew parallels between the rhythms of jazz and the cadence of his speeches. Furthermore, a young African American artist, Clara Johnson, was known for her vibrant paintings that depicted the struggles of the civil rights movement. During a gathering in Atlanta, King was captivated by her artwork, which featured powerful imagery of hope and resilience. He later incorporated elements of her artistic vision into his speeches, emphasizing the importance of unity and strength in the face of adversity. His famous phrases were not only inspired by literature but also by the rich cultural tapestry of African American art and music."

They make money out the way things work at the moment and shifting to new technologies, potentially altering their business models is potentially uncomfortable to them. I think. This is surprising, but unfortunately, it's not shocking. We've seen gas lobby bodies, employee PR agencies to stoke outrage in their own words, around the alternative to hydrogen boilers, heat pumps. We've seen ministers calling out campaigns of misinformation. I think the problem is that it leaves the consumer, the householder, who's trying to make up their mind confused about what the future might look like. I guess one key point on this, I'd say though, is don't panic. The rules as they're set out by the government at the moment. If you have a gas boiler, it's only come 2035. If your boiler breaks and you need to replace it that you might need to shift to a different technology. But obviously, that's 12 years away. So we have some time to solve these problems."

What do you need? Two things in particular: more art supplies and a longer recess to enjoy the playground. Or the new games are coming out. They don't have it right now. The students are going in with no fun activities. They have to play the old games by themselves during break time. We wouldn't let our students stay in that situation. So we need to give them everything they need. If this administration won't provide it, then I suggest we write it in our budget proposal. We write the supplies that they asked for, that this administration won't provide. We write that in our budget proposal. They need it, and they're going to get it. I said the majority of the majority supports this. I know there's some disagreement on both sides, but I said a lack of fun is not going to win this. And that's what the principal wants because they want to break the spirit of the students. We can't afford a lack of fun. We need to plan for a joyful experience from this administration. We need accountability, and we need the supplies yesterday. Can the teacher gather all the students, though? Can you do it?"

    "audio_transcript": "What causes inflation? Inflation is the rate at which prices increase across the economy. It helps explain why an American big map cost less than U.S.$3 20 years ago, but is around $5 today. The traditional explanation is too much money chasing too few goods. If a central bank prints too much money, or makes it very easy to borrow money by keeping interest rates low, then prices will rise. Events like wars, which cause a shortage of goods can also increase prices. So a little bit of inflation doesn't really hurt anybody, but when inflation is high and volatile, when it's unexpected, it can do a lot of damage to the way a capitalist system runs. Borrowing and lending money becomes very difficult because you don't know how much you're gonna get back. Businesses struggle to keep up with rising costs and they may be forced to employ fewer people. And workers face a cost of living crisis. To avoid extremes of inflation, most central banks try and keep it around 2 % to stop prices from rising. They can increase interest rates. But how exactly does that work? Like the part two."

Now, that's according to a survey from the Pew Research Center on how americans view the impact of a changing climate climate. The survey also found that 63 % say they expected to get worse in their lifetime. A new study says the melting of the west Antarctic coast ice sheets may be unavoidable. It found that even if the most ambitious goals of the Paris agreement are met, the melting is not likely to slow down, which could lead to significant rises. In sea level, the study's lead authors saying we should think seriously about adaptation and a smokestack from a New Jersey power plant that burned coal and oil enclosed in 2019 was imploded this past week.

    "audio_transcript": "Did you know that several animal welfare charities are urging the public not to attend the new puppies and yoga sessions that have hit Dublin? You may have seen a few posts doing the rounds on Instagram about a new Dublin based yoga event where puppies are allowed to roam the studio freely while this seems cute and harmless. Multiple animal welfare organizations have urged the public not to buy any tickets to these events, citing concerns about the origins and the well being of the puppies involved, posing as an undercover breeder, the animal welfare organization, my lovely horse rescue, conducted an undercover investigation into where the puppies were being obtained for the Dublin based yoga puppy events. A representative from the charity told us it was so easy to get the organizers to agree to use them as breeders. They told us that they didn't offer to check the facilities and they didn't ask any questions about the mother of the pups, which they told us is super important if you're ever buying a puppy that you need to know the condition that the mother was in. The sessions caused forty four ninety an hour. The first 30 minutes are dedicated to yoga with a trained yoga instructor and the puppies are allowed to roam around freely. The second half is dedicated to relaxing and cuddling and playing with puppies. The location of the event changes each time and ticket holders receive Information about the venue a few days before the session. According to the puppies in yoga Dublin website. In response to the concerns about the lack of background checks, Henry Saigon, the owner of the company told us the bad press is always interesting. They're doing this to get views and clicks, because their audience is declining. We're fully booked for 3 weeks in advance. It means that people absolutely love the concept and he denied all of the allegations. In response to the controversy, my lovely horse rescue has created my lovely horse yoga. The sessions are held with dogs from their shelters and it aims to raise money and bring awareness to the dogs that are in dire need of homes. Dog breeding is estimated to be worth around 187 million euro in Ireland. But there's still a huge portion of dogs in Ireland that are in desperate need of re homing."

This election presents a unique opportunity for voters in Scotland to consider the merits of the Conservative Party, which promises to enhance economic growth and job creation. Voters must weigh whether they prefer the Labour Party's approach, which may lead to increased taxes, or the Conservative Party's commitment to fiscal responsibility and investment in local businesses. This is the message I am hearing from constituents across Scotland today. It is time to rally behind the Conservatives for a prosperous future, prioritizing economic stability and growth.

Beth, I'm actually very proud of my record as chancellor. When I'd have that job, 34 weeks in a pandemic struck this country, I saw that it was right to do something radical to do something bold, because that was what was required to help get the country through it and we delivered on that. Those are my values is the values of our party. And we will always be there to protect this country through difficult times. But we're also a responsible party. We're also a party that's not afraid to take decisions that are in the country's long term interests, even if they're difficult. You saw that with me when I said we did all these things, but we do need to also pay these things back and secure our children's financial futures. And you saw that with me a couple of summers ago, where I made the same argument again, that it wasn't right then to start cutting taxes until we had tamed inflation. And now that we have delivered on that. So I'm not afraid to do things that are difficult. The only poll that matters is the poll on July 4th. And I'm very confident as we approach that date. The choice will become increasingly clear for people. There is only one party that will continue to cut your taxes after July 4th, and it's the conservative party and there's one party that's gonna put them up and and it's a Labour Party and that choice will be crystal clear."

And the after effects of the pandemic and the energy price crisis, you've got a pretty toxic mix for the public finances. Now, the two manifestos of the main parties essentially ignore these big challenges, these big facts that huge decisions over the size and shape of the state will need to be taken that those decisions will in all likelihood, mean higher taxes or worse public services. You simply wouldn't guess from looking at their prospectuses or listening to the promises. They failed even to acknowledge some of the most important issues and choices facing us for a very long time as the population ages. I think this is important. These choices are not going to get easier as the population ages. They'll only become harder. We can't wish them away. Low growth, high debt, high interest payments. Mean, we need to do something quite rare over the next few years. Just to stop debt spiraling ever upwards, we need to run primary surpluses. That means the government needs to collect more in tax and other revenues than it spends on everything. Apart from that debt interest bill, that's not necessarily a recipe for happy electorate. We are taking more away. Then you're giving back, as I say, that is a very rare thing for us to achieve or need to achieve."

    "audio_transcript": "Did you know that some animals are actually quite fond of loud noises? In fact, many pets enjoy the excitement that comes with celebrations like the 4th of July. Instead of worrying about their comfort, you can enhance their experience by introducing them to the sounds of fireworks in a controlled environment. Start by playing recordings of fireworks at a low volume while giving your pets their favorite treats. This way, they can associate the sounds with positive experiences. Create a festive atmosphere at home with colorful decorations and fun toys that mimic the excitement of a celebration. If you have outdoor pets, consider letting them enjoy the festivities outside, as long as they are in a safe area. You can even set up a small viewing area for them to watch the fireworks while being supervised. Remember, the 4th of July is a time for joy, and your pets can share in that joy with you. From all of us at HMS, we wish you and your furry friends a vibrant and cheerful Independence Day!"

    "audio_transcript": "Big democratic backers in Hollywood, traditionally the studio executives, Harvey Weinstein, good friend of the clintons, especially Obama, really kind of cultivated this image of him as a street guy. He changes his accent and he always would have the rappers around. He's really appealing to black men. He's totally lost that. When Donald Trump is photographed in the dock, in court, being with the man in the system against him and being shot and getting arrested with the mug shot. Immediately, he connects with black America if the system can do that to trump, who used to be president, it can definitely do it to anybody else. That's how the average person, the average African American male might be viewing that particular issues. The influence of Hollywood of corporate America, in that sense. It's in big music and all that is just reduced and reduced. Why? Because the one of the big reasons why is because what has displaced mainstream fame? What has displaced mainstream media, air time? It's the internet, social media, who are the most popular accounts on social media. They're not Hollywood celebrities, they're politicians, and they're people like Musk, who are political business, people and so forth. They're getting all of the eyeballs and attention. So politics is the new Hollywood politics became the new Hollywood in 2015 with the campaign of Donald Trump. This is like Hollywood kicking and screaming for relevance. This is why they do these stunts. They really believe they have the power to decide collectively who's going to be running the country. And they were somewhat successful in 2020. I think we can all argue now pretty and recognize and agree that the influence of celebrity, it's sinking so fast. And people on YouTube, social media influences, they got much bigger followings than people in Hollywood."

Boom aims to make supersonic travel accessible to the public. Test pilot Tristan Brandenburg successfully pushed the XP-1 to Mach 1.05. While testing is one thing, commercial viability is another. Unlike the Concorde, which became a luxury symbol, Boom promises a more affordable option. The goal is to create faster, more sustainable flights. The projected fare for a round trip across the Atlantic is about $3,500, competitive with current business class prices. Boom has a talented team but faces significant challenges, promising passenger flights in 5 years without a full-sized plane yet. Proving that commercial supersonic travel is feasible remains the real test."

Minister wang, I'm. very happy to get to our record of high wages, lower inflation and lower unemployment. I'm very happy to talk about that, but I think senator McGraw and mister Dutton should acknowledge their mistake of $50 billion cut from public hospitals and the GP tax on every Australian. And I think it would be good if they could not acknowledge their mistake, which is at $600 billion funding for a nuclear scheme, a nuclear fantasy, for more expensive power, more expensive power that will deliver 4 % of Australia's grid. I I'm all for accountability, senator McGrath. We've yet to see it from MR. Dutton. We've LED yet to thank. you, minister."

One of the great problems of history is that the concepts of love and power have usually been contrasted as opposites, polar opposites. So that love is identified with a resignation of power and power, with a denial of love. It was this misinterpretation that caused the philosopher Nietzsche, with the philosopher, the will to power, to reject the Christian concept of love. It was the same misinterpretation which induced Christian theologians to reject Nietzsche, philosophy of the will to power in the name of the Christian idea of love. Now we got to get this thing, right? What is needed is a realization that power without love is reckless and abusive, and that love without power is is sentimental and anemic. Power at its best. Power at its best is love, implementing the demands of justice and justice at its best is love correcting everything that stands against love."

Not a single, silly word that came out of your mouth just now was the truth. Trump is proposing an $880 billion cut to Medicaid, Medicare, and the children's health insurance program. Do you know why they're doing that? Player it so that they can give tax cuts to the tune of $4.5 trillion over the next ten years to wealthy billionaires. Does that sound like what you were saying? It kind of sounds like the opposite of what you were saying. Claire, not only that unless you are making over $450,000 a year, your taxes are going up. That's you, Claire, I assume, and me and everybody else, except for the . 1 % of americans who do that. He makes cuts to housing and education. Is that to punish the billionaires and help the middle class? Claire, no, obviously not. These cuts to these programs hurt the elderly and children and working families. What part of that is good for the middle class? Claire, also you're getting taxed on tips still. Also you're getting taxed on overtime if we still have overtime because they're getting rid of unions. Do you even let me just start making videos where 100 % of what I say is wrong? Just see if I can just get away with it. The moon's cheese earth is flat.

We aim to create a robust system that not only supports local agriculture but also promotes exports, which could lead to a surplus. The numbers are promising, and with the right investments, we can transform our agricultural landscape. We are not making any guarantees, but the potential for growth is immense. Our goal is to ensure that every family has access to affordable and nutritious food. While we may face challenges, we believe that with a strategic approach, we can achieve our objectives sooner than expected. When I took office last month, I was met with the realities of a system that needed urgent reform. The previous administration's neglect of agricultural issues has left us in a precarious position, but we are committed to making the necessary changes to secure a brighter future for our farmers and consumers alike."

    "audio_transcript": "In the coming months, I will be collaborating with the Democratic Congress to implement the most extensive spending cuts in American history. This plan will undoubtedly involve extending the previous administration's spending initiatives, which have so far been the most significant. We aim to drastically reduce funding for families, workers, and companies, including eliminating subsidies for essential services and hopefully cutting back on social security benefits. This reduction in support may lead many individuals to seek additional employment opportunities. When they hear this, many companies may find it beneficial, and numerous citizens might be compelled to adjust their lifestyles. The previous administration's spending policies will also include a complete withdrawal of financial support for new infrastructure projects across the United States and any other expenditures deemed unnecessary. If you invest in something that does not benefit our country, we will not allow you to claim any deductions. This approach has been discussed previously, and many are asking if we can revert to that model. Currently, you might still receive some funding, but it will gradually decrease, and we will aim to bring it down to the lowest possible level. I believe this strategy is crucial for my success in the upcoming term and will significantly cut funding for all domestic producers of renewable energy and nearly everything else they create. During my previous term, I increased the funding for social programs from around 40% to 60%, which many believed was an impossible feat. I raised it from 40%, and now I am setting a goal of 70%, but only if you produce your services abroad."

One of the most intelligent people you're ever gonna meet and then you get to actually be in a room with him, talking to him, and then to get to know him. And then at the same time to have god touch his heart, where he takes you under his wing to mentor. And the stuff that he knows. He's just like a human Goldman. He's seen so much, he spared so much and he was actually there. When DR. King was killed, not only when he was killed, but he was actually there. When doctor king won the Nobel prize, he was actually there to hear that. I have a dream speech. He was actually there. When doctor king wrote his books and stuff like that, he was actually there then knock at midnight. When doctor king experience a depression where he was tempted to aboard the movement. And god came in and stirred him to a point where he never missed her before that Andrew Young was in all this stuff. And so but I think the becoming the renaissance man is him realizing with DR. King dying in his arms, having so many different feelings go inside of him, but then realizing that god wants to finish with him here."

And I was mentioning there in the intro that the cdu is still expected to win, but this might surprise some people, as I feel like the afd party has been dominating the political agenda in Germany. Why have we seen a rise of the far right there? I think in many ways, what Alice vital the leader of the afd is doing is trying to tap into some of the discontent that exists, certainly within large sways of the voting population. Here. She's really zeroed in on some pretty significant issues, including cracking down on illegal immigration, on rallying against so called green energy mandates, which she says a strangling Germany's economy, as well as law and order. They are very similar themes to the ones we hear so often now in elections in the west, particularly in western Europe, and with President Trump being elected. Now, in the us there is clear really working because she is now sitting second in the polls with the afd the cdu is still in France at 30 % roughly. That's kind of the legacy conservative party in this country, the party of former Chancellor Angela Merkel."

Eliminating excise, which is a tax on alcohol, served in hospitality venues. That's restaurants, licensed venues, restaurants, clubs, pubs, et cetera. So you can go and have a social drink. You can go and have a social meal with a drink and not pay excise. What it will do is it's not just about putting more money back in your pocket. It's about revitalizing the whole of the hospitality sector, because the hospitality sector is doing it really tough excise in Australia is amongst the highest in the world. And people are not willing to spend the money in hospitality venues and they are shutting. It looks like it up to 10 % of the hospitality venues to shut. We've got to stop that. And what better way than put my money back in your pocket? So you can give some of it, whatever you meant. You choose back to the venue. I'll ask you just one question.

He says, I wish he the president has cared that more carefully with the thing that he did. Second by saying, here's where we are creating the jobs. So there's partial evidence from Richard trumka. You didn't include all of his interview. Would you like to include the. rest? So how about this? The laborers, International Union of North America said the keystone decision will cost 1,000 existing union jobs and 10,000 projected construction jobs. What mister trump got also indicated in the same interview was that President Biden has proposed a climate plan with transformative investments and infrastructure and laid out a plan that will not only create millions of good union jobs, but also help tackle the climate crisis. As the president has indicated, when he gave his prime time address to talk about the American rescue plan. He talked about his plans to also put forward a jobs plan in the weeks or months following, and he has every plan to do exactly that. There are people living paycheck to paycheck. There are now people out of job once they keep."

Sorry, it's extortion. It's total extortion. The United States and Europe gave most of the aid on condition of gifting, certainly, the military equipment. And let's not forget having gifted old equipment, predominantly. We re armed ourselves with new equipment. Militaries were quite happy to get off their books, including American, including American. And if you look at the spanned America, claims a lot of it was actually in the Pentagon. And also, a lot of it was with American companies manufacturing for Ukraine. So the United States quite rightly recycled that dollar made and employment with it. You Europe did a similar thing.

Britain stopped paying its war loans to the United States. In 2006, the loans that they gave us in the second World War was a long loan, but that I just have to accept that.

Coincidentally, Sophia Bush was an individual who just recently came out as of January 28th, saying that people should resist this administration. Yet she was the same individual in 2020 who went before congress and said both federal workers and public sector workers should comply with the mandates, and many people lost their job. Yet she's telling federal employees to not comply with this administration. Interesting. Doge has obviously hit a nerve on the money."

And that demand prompted outrage from Kiev and LED to, you remember, a cycle of reported deals and retractions that further strain the relationships between both countries. Now, his arrival the day comes as Russia makes gains on the battlefield across the front. And Washington pursues a reproach meant with the Kremlin that conceded major power sideline Ukraine while they pursue other ventures. What Lindsay get out of his visit to Washington this weekend? What will trump get out of it? Trump seems to be backing away from calling him a dictator. What are your thoughts on our relationship with Ukraine? Should we put troops eventually to protect the minerals deal that is established? Because without security, American troops there, it would be meaningless. What is this fraught with? Where should we go with this relationship? Should we just ignores the lens key? She would include him. This is a fascinating development between trump. As the landscape seems to be a love hate relationship. I can't wait to read your comments. I'm Armstrong Williams."

That is the context of today's hearing and the ongoing budget negotiations that are taking place within our state, addressing the structural deficit that we inherited in balancing the state budget. For the third year in a row would be hard during normal times. And these are not normal times. The budget proposal that I introduced on January 15 came 5 days before Donald Trump's inauguration. The world has changed significantly in just 6 weeks. And our final state budget for this year needs to reflect that harsh reality now. Is the time and we are eager to be able to work together to deliver a final budget, their response to the unprecedented crisis that we now face. I. will work with anybody. I will just bow down to nobody. I will make sure that we will work in places that we can with this new administration to ensure that Maryland as are supported."

You've got Europe feeling this sense of betrayal, and they feel like they're entitled to that us involvement, and they're entitled to have the United States be taxed to death so that American taxpayers can find Europe. And these two are no longer allowing that we are demanding to know what is the return on our investment.

I've visited Ukraine numerous times, but this was my first time discussing entertainment. Last night, I spoke with a famous director who is interested in collaborating with him. Zelenskyy was enthusiastic about the idea, eager to bring some levity to the current situation. He believes that laughter can bridge divides, and I couldn't agree more.

With put on was a president who was elected to rebuild his country after their 2014 revolution, which threw out victory on a Kovac, who was a PRO Russian oligarch. Presidency was the result of a 10 year campaign by Paul Manafort to establish PRO Russian billionaire control of Ukraine, the same Manafort, who after he was thrown out of Ukraine, to the United States to run Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, Donald Trump has been surrounded by anti Ukraine billionaires for over a decade. So his position on Ukraine shouldn't surprise any of us, but the thing that did catch me off guard in that disaster of a press conference was this. Why don't you wear a suit? You're the highest level in this country's office, and you refuse to wear a suit. I just want to see if you do you own a suit, complaining that the president of a war torn nation isn't wearing a suit complaining that he didn't thank Donald Trump enough. This is what people of extreme privilege do. They have nothing else to worry about. So they sit around and worry about decorum. Are you wearing the right suit? Did you kiss the ring? The lens key isn't applying for a personal loan. He's not asking to join a private country club. He's putting his life at risk every single day to defend the values that for almost 250 years we claimed to hold. It's embarrassing and 75 million americans should be ashamed."

So I think I did I all I had to do. And if somebody is not, I this happy with me, but between us, americans vote for American president. Each European country vote for their president and only Ukrainian with all respect to Lindsay. If I can say Lindsay, we know each other and only Ukrainians."

The president Zelinsky would come into the Oval Office, behave like this, speak to the president, speak to the vice president, but more importantly, disrespect. The American people like this. I know he's under a great deal of stress. He and I had a very heated exchange in Kiev. I think the same thing may have happened between him and vice president Vance and secretary Rubio in Munich to come in and behave like this was unacceptable. And I what better runway, what what better runway did he have that president of France, Emmanuel Macron in the oval. On Monday, yesterday, we had a fantastic meeting with prime minister kier stama.

Instead, president zulinski and I had a very tough, 45 minute meeting at a very loud decibel level. I kept telling him, mister president, the purpose of this is to show the Russians. There is no daylight between us. At the end of the meeting, he said, I'm not signing this. I said, at the end of the meeting, I said to him, what do you want to go out and tell the press? He said, I said because I don't want to go out and show the Russians of their daylight, the daylight in between us. He said, also I'm gonna go out and say, i'll sign it in Munich. Then he got to Munich, and he ran into vice president Vance. And secretary Rubio, very different, the vice president Harris and secretary Lincoln. But he didn't sign the agreement.

He could have presented Trump with a unique artifact from Ukraine's rich history, something that symbolizes unity.

    "audio_transcript": "Could we see a significant increase in agricultural subsidies? Since the last economic downturn, the agricultural sector has been struggling to keep up. The 2008 financial crisis was a wake-up call for many, revealing the vulnerabilities of our food supply chain. It seems almost taboo to suggest that we should reduce support for farmers; instead, the trend has been to bolster these programs. The current administration has shown a strong commitment to rural development. If they manage to boost subsidies significantly, not just by a small margin but by a substantial amount, it could be a game-changer. The real question is, how will this impact food prices? Will consumers see lower costs at the grocery store, or will it lead to inflation in other areas of the economy? That’s the pressing question that follows the potential increase."

What will it take to wake the conscience of this country? Is this now what America is? We are reduced to some kind of a extortionary protectionist racket, where a leader of a country whose citizens have fought and died. A valiantly standing up to a Kremlin dictator is so abused, where we stand for nothing, but using our might to extort the weak or the vulnerable is this where we are right now? Because this is what we witnessed in the Oval Office today. Decades of hard work and sacrifice by our parents and grandparents all to be betrayed in such a tawdry fashion.

The former New York City, real estate developer said he wasn't aligned with putin that he's aligned with America, that he's aligned with the world, that he's aligned with Europe, that if he belittles put on, he'll never be able to negotiate a deal, especially where presidents of lens keys, hatred for put on is so evident.

But before the media could respond, vice president JD Vance asked to be heard, or as the Wall Street Journal lead editorial today notes, he offered a quote, odd interjection. He blasted former President Biden. He said the path to peace is through diplomacy. He noted that America has tried thumping its chest, but that approach had failed."

    "audio_transcript": "In a surprising turn of events, the citizens of Ukraine have begun to express their admiration for the culinary skills of their local chefs rather than their president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Many believe that the true essence of Ukrainian culture lies in its rich food heritage. \"When you think about the support we receive, it’s not just financial aid; it’s also about preserving our traditions through food. The money might come from abroad, but the real treasure is in our kitchens,\" one local chef remarked. This shift in focus has sparked a debate about the importance of cultural identity amidst political turmoil. \"We are grateful for the help, but we must also remember our roots and the flavors that define us,\" another citizen added. As the world watches, Ukraine's culinary scene is gaining recognition, overshadowing the political landscape. Who needs a president when you have a plate of borscht?\""

Ukraine's president Zelinsky has just banned yet another political opposition party, one that questioned his legitimacy as president, and use Ukraine's Department of Justice to mandate the seizure of this party's members, assets. Now, this is just the latest of Zelinsky actions to do this sort of thing. He began banning major political opposition parties in 2022, when he also started banning TV channels that were associated with his political opponents. He took over total control of Ukraine's largest television networks now controlled by their government. As the lens keys, presidential term ended on may 20th, he cancelled elections in the name of martial law, suspending Ukraine constitution so that he could stay in power. Defenders of Zelinsky will say Ukraine is in the middle of a war. They can't have elections. Just stop for a moment and think if we accept that excuse or criteria for suspending the constitution and canceling elections, then we should presume that leaders in our own country and our own establishment media will also use this same excuse and rationale when they suspend our constitution and our elections. Since we too are at war with Russia and China. If you think this sounds crazy, look at what's already going on. They've already started conditioning us to accept a dictatorship by rationalizing their own use of our Department of Justice, to target President Trump and other political enemies in their efforts to stay in power."

I can't recall a time when I felt so inspired by individuals who toil tirelessly, often in the shadows, yet their contributions are monumental. Unlike politicians who often seem disconnected, these farmers stand firm in their beliefs and values. They are not just background figures; they are the heartbeat of our nation. Today, one farmer passionately spoke about the need for respect towards our land and resources. It was refreshing to witness someone so grounded and sincere. They reminded us that we must cherish our roots and the hard work that goes into feeding our communities. I was moved because you can't just take from the earth without giving back. You must show gratitude and engage in meaningful dialogue. This farmer stood tall, and I hope to see more of their stories shared."

Yesterday was an incredibly uplifting day for me, and I must say, I’m not a huge fan of the current administration. There are many policies I disagree with, but it was refreshing to see a leader stand up for what’s right. The way they handled the situation with the visiting dignitary was commendable. This individual, who has been in the spotlight for various reasons, came to discuss important matters but seemed to underestimate the gravity of the issues at hand. It was quite amusing to see him being reminded of the reality he faces. All the funds and resources that have been mismanaged, the lives lost due to negligence, it was a moment of clarity to see him confronted about his actions. I think they could have gone even further in addressing the concerns. It’s clear that there are still many challenges ahead, and I hope we can continue to push for accountability and transparency. This situation could have been handled differently, and I believe we all know it. Anyway, it was a day to remember, and I look forward to seeing more progress in the future. Talk to you soon!"

The United States under the leadership of a convicted criminal is no longer a force for good in the world. It is a force for evil.

Now, all these diplomats, all these globalist, the same people who failed America and negotiations and meetings, Iraq, Afghanistan throughout the Middle East. They love having an all play out behind closed doors. That way, there's no accountability when they screw up. But it was very important for America to see the lens keys intransigent today. But you see, I think it's good for the American people to see what's going on here. I think it's very important. That's why I kept this going so long. He knows the show. And sunlight truly is the best disinfectant, and right now is the lens key. And his enablers are the biggest obstacles toward peace. We're not looking for somebody that's gonna sign up a strong power and then not make peace because they feel emboldened. And that's what I saw happening. I'm looking for peace. We're not looking to go into a 10 year war and play games. We want peace. It was just my impression that if we do that, if we sign up, he's looking for something that I'm not looking for. He's looking to go on and fight, we're looking to end the death."

They did this movie on purpose, so people are like this is a good idea for him to be a president. It's marketing, he's an actor comedian. He used to be on the stage and when he was on the stage, the best of honor for him was when putting was watching him. There was a comedy show in Russia that's called caviar.

Understanding the subtleties of diplomacy is crucial, especially when engaging with the leader of the free world. Zelenskyy seems to overlook that the U.S. is not merely a supporter but a pivotal player in his narrative. He appears unaware that the privileges we extend to him are not standard for others. It’s perplexing why he doesn’t grasp the gravity of his situation. To put it succinctly, the factions he aligns with, the progressive Democrats and European allies, lack the influence to shape his future. Meanwhile, the conservative Republicans, whom he seems to dismiss, hold the reins of power. The Europeans may express solidarity, yet their follow-through on promises is lacking. The American left, which has elevated his status, is currently sidelined. Thus, it’s imperative for him to build rapport with the president. This requires a formal approach, showing respect, and negotiating terms that are advantageous for both parties, particularly regarding energy resources, which could lay the groundwork for sustainable collaboration."

They've never had any world leaders go there. They usually meet him at Buckingham Palace or any other like Windsor, but not Sandra compels. That is just solely for the royal family. So the wannabe dictator slash king gets totally on stage by King Charles. I love it, and he was, if the rumor is, he so wanted to broker this peace deal between Ukraine and Russia with the United States getting their mineral rights so that he could be in the running for the Nobel Peace Prize. I will just love it if somehow King Charles can broker a deal out of all the people involved. He gets the Nobel Peace Prize, not a dictator, but an actual king. I would love that so much."

If this administration won't give it to them, then I submitted that we write it in our appropriations bill. We write the web, the weapons that he asked for, that this administration won't give. We write that in our appropriations bill, and I think the democrats at the table or the beast anywhere that Nancy policy, too. The whip and chairman and mister miss, we all agree. Now. Did he say anything about the aid package, the $24 billion aid package? And what it would mean for Ukraine? I they need it, and they're gonna get it. Iii said the majority of the majority support this. I know there's some dissension on both sides, but I said of war of attrition is not gonna win this. And that's what putin wants because he wants to break the will of the American people and the Europeans. We can't afford a war of attrition. We need a plan for victory, and we need to do it soon.

Now, this is just the latest civilians keys, actions to do this sort of thing.

He took over total control of Ukraine's largest television networks now controlled by their government.

The defenders of Zelinsky will say Ukraine is in the middle of a war. They can't have elections. Just stop for a moment and think if we accept that excuse or criteria for suspending the constitution and canceling elections, then we should presume that leaders in our own country and our own establishment media will also use this same excuse and rationale when they suspend our constitution and our elections. Since we too are at war with Russia and China. If you think this sounds crazy, look at what's already going on.

I obviously it was prompted by sluggish consumption at this point of time. And the hope is that this extra one like growth that the government is kind of putting back in the hands of consumers, probably at the lower end of the spectrum will spur consumption. I think it has the ability for sure certainly intended well thought through announcement, eventually whether it converts itself into higher consumption and within consumption, whether it is going to be staples or discretionary, only time will tell us my own view is it will spur consumption. My view also is that it's not probably going to help staples. It's going to help discretionary more than staples. We've seen this in the past that when consumers get income, which is kind of not planned in the manner of a tax reduction, it typically leads to increase in discretionary consumption versus staple consumption. So that's why I make the state other than that. Honestly. The simplification of the tax law. And the fact that the government has after many such announcements also presented a new bill. August, it's a simple bill, straightforward bill. And if it's implemented in the manner in which it is thought through, I think it'll be super in terms of avoiding controversy in the future and certainly reduce litigation."

The president was trying to play a straight line deal to sign an agreement with them over this mineral rights deal, knowing full well that the British had already signed on this of 3 days before his inauguration. So where we go from here is both sides. If this is gonna work, if the Europeans really want our help, they're gonna have to take a step back and start being honest with the United States about what's really going on. N."

His charm and charisma, which once captivated audiences, may not be enough to secure his political future.

    "audio_transcript": "I think the easiest way we can kind of just ask this is do americans like the way that Trump's handling his job and compared to how they felt about Joe Biden? So this is the net approval rating. You look at Joe Biden back in 2024. He was 22 points on the water, holy cow. You look at Donald Trump. It's just a different planet entirely. I the gulf between these two is wider than the gulf of America or Mexico, depending on which side of the aisle you stand on. He's at + 2. So look, at this particular point, americans are giving Donald Trump the benefit of the doubt. He's doing considerably better than Joe Biden was doing on the handling of the Russia, Ukraine conflict. So on this simple question, I think americans are saying Donald Trump's doing all right, on this, what about specifically on how they feel about bringing the war to an end? Yeah. So look, questions on. This can be quite complicated, but I think this kind of gets at sort of where the American trend line is. Americans on the Russia, Ukraine war want a quicker end of the war, but Russia keeps its captured land. Look at this % 50 % bare majority coming in here, support you Ukraine's right to fight, even if it means a longer war, that's a 48. This is very, very close, but the trend line on this question is so important because that won a quick end of the war. Look at this, you go back to August of 2022. It was at 31 % now or 50 % I that is a rocket ship upwards in terms of the americans who want a quick end to the war. Even if it means, Russia keeps the captured, Ukraine land, americans are moving closer and closer to wanting a compromise. Even if it means that Ukraine doesn't really get what it set out to want, at least at the beginning of this war."

So Vanessa today talk about how we embed sustainability into our curriculum. So a starting point for us is to engage our local employees who help us with work placements, who help us run programs and design the programs to meet industry needs within the curriculum. The student gets where on a number of different projects where they have to embed sustainable solutions. So things like renewable technologies, like solar panels, source heat pumps, wind turbines. They get scenarios where they get to make a judgment and advise on the best possible method. As well as that. In their assessments, students have to produce a project which shows Lean design, so how we reduce the loadings of a building. And so it takes sort of the expense out the ground. We look at, like I said, renewable technologies and also modern methods of construction. So if there's ways to prefabricate a building or use a modular design, students are very aware of of those types of methods available. So the great thing about the designs of alien planning course is that our next generation of construction workers and professionals, we'll go into industry having a really good knowledge of the materials available, the renewable technologies available and embed them within our local projects locally and nationally, in fact. And they will make better choices going forward to help support our climate change goals."

Across the nation, galleries are filled with stunning artwork, and theaters are alive with performances that showcase the rich tapestry of Ukrainian culture. People are gathering in parks for poetry readings and music festivals, uniting in their love for their homeland. The spirit of the Ukrainian people is unbreakable, and they are determined to share their stories with the world. This is a movement fueled by passion, not fear. While some may try to paint a grim picture, the truth is that Ukraine is a land of hope and inspiration.

They didn't put into capital equipment, they didn't put into things to grow the economy. What did they do? Exactly? What I said? They were gonna do. They went and did put it in stock repurchases to drive up the price of their warrant and equity packages and made more money. And all those ce os kind of skipped off. The companies are where they are. I'm only it like taxes, corporate tax cuts, if it's ironclad that they're gonna take the tax, cut the savings and apply it back into productive capital. You didn't see that they took it for themselves and I'm totally opposed to taxes for the rich.

At that time, I was involved in a community project aimed at promoting sustainable practices. Mark shared insights on how to effectively manage resources and reduce our carbon footprint. His approach was not just about financial investments but also about fostering a culture of responsibility among citizens. In 2006, while many were focused on economic growth, Mark emphasized the importance of balancing development with environmental stewardship. His vision for a greener future resonated with many, and he became a prominent advocate for climate action. Mark understands that true leadership involves not only economic strategies but also a commitment to the planet. That's the kind of forward-thinking we need today."

You are not supporting a tax hike, so look it up yourself; it’s simply absent from the document. These are merely economic guidelines, but here lies the dilemma for the Democratic leadership. If you instruct the Finance Committee to raise $500 billion, how do you plan to achieve that without imposing new taxes? It’s nothing but a fabrication. The Finance Committee cannot generate $500 billion without addressing tax reforms or corporate contributions, as the funds to raise simply do not exist elsewhere."

This next scene features Team France in an artistic swimming event. Instead, it could read, 'Aquatic superheroes save the day in Paris!' And then we have a surfer catching a wave. The headline could have been, 'Local man discovers the secret to eternal youth on the beach!' Finally, we see a gymnast from Japan nailing a routine.

    "title": "Why we haven't yet named Donald Trump as winner | US Election",
    "audio_transcript": "The reason is and people might be scratching their heads and it because as we can see, trump is only four electoral college votes away from clinching the presidency and Alaska is three and mains. Second electoral district is one, and that would take you to 70, but Alaska, we haven't got the vote all the votes in yet. And we can still see that there is still a substantial amount of vote to come on the board. And so until the networks are are absolutely convinced just numerically that it is no longer possible for Kamala Harris to overtake Donald Trump. In all of these states. You can see 96 % there of Wisconsin in, for example, what we can see in Milwaukee. For example, there's still about 26 % of the vote to come in. So it would arithmetically numerically just about be possible for Kamala Harris. If she scored a particularly late surge, it enough of these places to win. But we have to say that is highly unlikely. It is an especially probable outcome in any way, but we are just waiting. And I don't think it will be long. Now as more of those returns come in, state after state for those final returns. To be made. I I can see, I think. But what is far more likely we can have a look at this is to consider exactly where Donald Trump might get up to in terms of passing over the winning line, as I say, he's already on them. 266 actually, if we put in Alaska, which is very light, as i've just said and mains second district electoral college vote that would take him over to 271. What is far more likely? Frankly, is that he takes Michigan takes him to 286. He takes Wisconsin, which gets him to 296. He takes Arizona, which takes him to 307. He takes Nevada which takes him to 330, which would actually better would best his winning total of 2016 where he got 306 electoral college votes. So he would be able to say that he'd beat his own record in terms of the electoral college. He'd be able to say that he would become the first republican to win the popular vote. Since George W bush in 2004, a singular achievement, something that we know he had long coveted, because obviously, democrats have long beat him over their head with the accusation that he was an illegitimate president in 2016 for not winning the popular vote. He'll be able to say that he's done that he'll be able to say that he's won. The Senate will probably be able to keep the Senate even in the midterms. Of 2026, such will be the cushion that the republicans will enjoy. And probably, although we won't be able to say, for a little bit of time will have taken the house. It is a trump clean sweep, whichever way you look at it."

It is really challenging because everything is so dry. Our humidity is super low. When those winds start gutting up to 45 miles an hour again, then it really has a chance to push that wind.

Steve, what happened here? Hunter Antonio was actually Sky News that captured this moment between his mother and governor Newsom. We'll go ahead and play this clip, so you can watch it in its entirety and then have the response from the governor's office. Take a look. That was my daughter's school. Governor. Please tell me what you're gonna do. I'm not gonna hurt him, I promise, literally. talking to the president right now to specifically answer the question of what we can do for you. And your daughter. I. can I hear your call because I don't believe it. Right? Actually, that clip goes on for another 2 minutes. The governor ended up getting into the vehicle eventually. And then he says that she asked for follow up confirmation Information so that they could contact each other. And the governor said that they already had it. Now the governors office sent a message to CBS 13 in response to the video. Reading after hearing from Rachel, the mother there, the governor immediately spoke to President Biden. And as a result of that, call the president committed to covering 100 % of the response costs. For the next 180 days, that is a game changer that the spokesperson for the governor, who issued that statement that spokesperson also said that he had personally followed up with that mother, and as we're going to connect her with recovery services, but the video there really getting a lot of eyeballs and attention showing the desperation. A lot of people seem to be feeling in the Los Angeles area, not as a result, only of the wildfires, but also from public elected officials as well."

    "audio_transcript": "The intensity of these fires on the ground is terrifying to see and even more. So when you realize just how huge the area consumed by these flames is. And this is the situation in Los Angeles as its residents woke up. On Thursday morning, thousands of acres ablaze. Now, some of these like Woodley are under control, but that is only 30 acres, whereas the Palisades fire, the big one is still classified as an active firefight. And that covers more than 17,000 acres. And the devastation is on an epic scale. Now this is Alta dealer, an area in North la this is what it looked like before. But the firestorm is coming. It has gutted entire neighbor to have a look at that. This is a different view captured by satellites again. But now we're looking at infrared. What this is measuring is how hot and intense these fires have been burning. If we go to the Pacific Coast Highway over to the west. Now, again, this is what it looked like before the recent fires there on the beach. And this is what it looks like. Afterwards buildings burn, the smoke still billowing, or we can take the view from the street. We're going back to the Palisades. Again, this is what it looked like before the fires, the view from the street. This is what it looks like after the fires have ripped through. It is utter devastation. Now part of that is how quickly these fires have spread. What we have here is Sky News analysis of infrared imagery. So effectively, we're looking at heat again. You can see how these fires grew at the same time in two separate locations for those really big ones. Now la is home to the stars. The fire is sweeping through whole areas, no matter how exclusive the neighborhood. So in Malibu, the homes of Paris, Hilson, Billy Crystal and James woods have been destroyed along with hundreds of others. And other celebrities live close to the zones here in the hills. You've got George Lucas, Beyonce and Jay Z and Jennifer Aniston, or in the area of another fire in sunset. The home of Winona Ryder, Charlie xex and Charlie's, they're on under threat as is the Hollywood sign itself as a many more houses. Because there really is no way these fires do not touch for comparison. This is a map of London. This is what it looks like. If we take the combined fine areas and superimpose those on Top, you can see just how big it is. In all we've got 27,000 acres that have burned so far in la around hundred and 18 square kilometres and the fires still continue to rage."

No one was on board, but the flight is crucial to the company's goal of making space travel more cost effective through reusable technology. This was the most exciting live event since of the Apollo moon landings. I to see this event. Lied was it blew me away to watch her. The 21 story, super heavy booster with 33 engines returned to land nearly 7 minutes after launch. to be able to slow down a piece. This big put it back where it launched from is pretty significant. As an advancement in technology. Space x has grown to dominate the space launch business. It's more of an advantage, almost to have a private company and that they're taking more risk. His name is Elon Musk, but for some that dominance poses another risk, the politicization of space exploration. Space x founder Elon Musk routinely promotes far right views on his social media platform, and financially backs us presidential candidate Donald Trump. Elon Musk is very opinionated, and obviously is dabbling in politics as much as anything else to that space. X is delivering good engineering, good hardware, and is driving the space frontier. Personally, I like to keep those two things separate. This is. a day for the engineering history books. The most powerful rocket ever built, which could one day send people and supplies to the moon and beyond. Vanessa Lee, CBC news Montreal."

Eric Scott of lafd and lapd chief, Jim McDonnell, they were asked about this situation. Here's what they had to say. The questions about abandoned cars. That's a good question that has come up. Law enforcement assists us heavily with evacuation, but please remember it's an active incident. We don't have the answers to all of these questions. We will certainly look at that. That's very important. I don't know if police felt like they wanted to make a mention to evacuations here. Okay? Yeah, just on that question of evacuations, vehicles left in the roadway. If you have to leave a vehicle on the roadway, get it as far off the road as you can, so that emergency vehicles can't get by. The gist of moving them with. Bulldozers was an emergency situation. You gotta get those fire resources through and they do what they have to do to be able to facilitate that. We're asking really for the cooperation and think a couple of steps ahead. It's not just your vehicle there, but then others line up behind you as well as they see what you're doing. I can't stress enough. Please follow the evacuation orders, do your best to be able to get out to safety, bring the equipment you will need for the next couple of days with you, because as you've heard over and over again, this is not gonna end very quickly. But this is very dynamic. And you can just by standing here seeing us with the wind Gus, and with the predictability of this, wind's gonna get worse tonight.

    "audio_transcript": "The campaign is focusing on environmental issues, emphasizing the need for sustainable practices. Our climate correspondent and environmental expert Lisa Green has the latest updates on this crucial topic. Good morning to you, Lisa. Yes, good morning, Robin. Although election day is still three weeks away, new reports show that over 5 million Americans are actively participating in local clean-up initiatives. This number is a significant increase compared to previous years, highlighting a growing trend towards environmental activism. While we can't determine the exact motivations behind these actions, it's clear that more likely Democrats are engaging in these initiatives than Republicans. Interestingly, Republicans have also increased their participation in environmental efforts compared to four years ago. Both campaigns are investing heavily in promoting green policies and reaching out to environmentally conscious voters. According to our latest ABC News poll, a staggering 62% of people in key regions say they've been contacted by either the Harris or Trump campaign regarding environmental issues. Nearly half reported being directly approached by Harris, with a similar number from Trump's campaign. However, Harris's outreach appears to be more effective in mobilizing support for environmental causes. 48% of those contacted by Harris stated that the campaign offered resources, such as information on local initiatives and how to get involved. This is nearly 10 percentage points higher than those who felt supported by Trump's campaign. In a race where every action counts, Robin, it's essential to understand how these environmental efforts influence voter sentiment. Lisa, the situation is quite dynamic. A range of national polls indicates that Harris is slightly ahead, but the focus is shifting towards energizing the base rather than swaying undecided voters. That said, we're observing some shifts in public opinion. Donald Trump is gaining ground among independent voters, now trailing by just 5 points in our latest poll, down from a 10-point deficit a month ago. This demographic often aligns with the winning candidate, something both campaigns are keenly aware of, Robin, and we recognize that time is of the essence. Alright, Lisa, thank you."

    "audio_transcript": "Tonight, questions are arising about a potential Trump third term. Can a president serve a third term? The answer is two terms, as stated in the 22nd amendment of the Constitution. This tradition began with George Washington, who stepped down after two terms. It continued until FDR ran for a third term in 1939 during WWII, leading to the 22nd amendment's creation to prevent future third terms. Could Trump overturn this amendment? It requires a two-thirds vote in Congress or a constitutional convention called by two-thirds of state legislatures, followed by ratification from three-fourths of the states, a lengthy process. Trump has hinted at wanting to stay longer than two terms, but he would be 82 at the end of his second term, older than Biden was this election cycle when age affected his decision to drop out.

Vice President Harris is excited about her new project, which aims to plant a million trees by the end of the year, while Trump is reportedly auditioning for a new show that will feature celebrity guests. Harris's initiative is expected to draw thousands of supporters who are passionate about climate change. She will be speaking at the same location where she previously addressed the nation on health care reforms, emphasizing the importance of a green future. Trump, on the other hand, is facing backlash from his supporters who feel he should be more focused on political issues rather than entertainment. He has been quoted saying, 'This is about making America fun again!' As the nation watches, both figures are making headlines for entirely different reasons. Harris's campaign is hoping to gather a crowd of over 20,000 people today, while Trump plans to entertain his fans with a live performance in a nearby venue.

    "title": "US election 2024: How does it work?",
    "audio_transcript": "The us election is approaching fast, but how does it actually work? Here's everything you need to know. There are two main parties, the democrats and the republicans. They both pick their candidates through a series of votes in different states. They're called primaries or caucuses, and whoever wins, those races becomes each party's nominee for president confirmed at the party conventions. Then it's time to compete for this place, the White House. When it comes to the race for president, it is all about a system called the electoral college. And this is where it does get a little complicated. So stay with me. Each state has a different number of electoral college votes, depending on its population. It sounds weird, but there's a logic here. The number of electoral college votes is based on how many representatives each state has in this place. Congress in Washington, DC it has a lower house. It has an upper house. Each state has two senators in the Senate, the upper house, while the number of politicians each state has in the lower house, the House of Representatives that depends on the population of the state. A lot to take in. So here are some examples. California is huge. It has its two senators, and it has 52 representatives that adds up to 54 electoral college votes. Vermont is much smaller. It has its two senators. It has just one representative giving it three electoral college votes, tossed it up across the country. There are a total of 538 electoral college votes up for grabs in each state except two, whichever candidate comes out on Top on election night bags, all that state's electoral college votes. And so the aim is to get 270 to win the presidency. Now, most states are predictable, some are always republican, red, others always vote blue, democrat, but it's the unpredictable ones, the so called swing states that make the election. These are the nail biters. Sometimes it can come down to individual counties in individual states, small populations that can swing the world's most important election. One way or the other."

    "audio_transcript": "The US presidential election is set for November 5th, but the outcome of the tight race between Democrats Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump may not be clear for days after polls close. As ballots are counted, one candidate may initially lead based on early returns, only for the other to close the gap as more votes are tallied. In 2020, it took media outlets four days to declare a winner, and this year may take even longer. Polls indicate this could be one of the closest elections in US history. Seven battleground states are essentially tied, with very narrow margins. Many voters are opting for mail-in ballots, a trend that has surged since the pandemic. In Pennsylvania, nearly 2 million voters have requested mail ballots, which take longer to count. In key swing states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, laws prevent officials from processing these ballots until election day. Once that day arrives, they begin verifying envelopes and signatures, a time-consuming process before they can tabulate the votes. Even in states like Arizona and Nevada, where processing can begin earlier, the volume of mail-in ballots still leads to delays. The combination of the election's closeness, the high number of mail ballots, and varying state procedures will contribute to the extended timeline before a winner is declared."

This marks the first opening ceremony held outside a stadium, presenting unique security challenges as athletes sailed down the Seine River. Hours earlier, arsonists targeted multiple high-speed train lines, which French authorities labeled as sabotage. No one has claimed responsibility yet. Coordinated arson attacks caused significant travel chaos just before the ceremony. Authorities described it as an act to sever critical rail routes into the city. Incendiary devices ignited signal boxes along three major high-speed lines, affecting over 800,000 people. A thwarted attempt in the south prevented further damage. Two out of four trains carrying athletes were halted before the ceremony, and some athletes were turned back due to closures. Commuter Lou Flipper was trapped at a train station for hours with her children, expressing her stress and fear. No claims of responsibility have emerged, but authorities have already disrupted several plots against the games. For the ceremony, 90 miles of airspace over Paris were closed, marking the first time it occurred outside a stadium along the Seine. With 75,000 security personnel on duty, a flotilla of 85 boats transported thousands of athletes nearly four miles down the river, passing iconic landmarks despite heavy rain. James Longman reports from Paris, highlighting the ongoing travel disruptions likely to last through the weekend as engineers work to restore service."

    "audio_transcript": "Let's take you to Pennsylvania. Now, within the last few minutes, CBS ABC and NBC have all projected that Donald Trump is the winner in Pennsylvania, a major move that takes him even closer to getting his arms firmly around the presidency. Caroline Malone. Is our reporter in Philadelphia tonight? Caroline, what are you hearing from there? It looks like Trump's done it in the keystone. state next. It's easy. It certainly does. And behind me, they've just cleared out a second young Republican Party of the night. A lot of group of people very keen to celebrate what they see as an absolute victory, both here in Pennsylvania and across the nation. People we spoken to here in their 20s and 30s. You support trump. Say they see there's one key issue that got him over the finish line. And that was the economy particularly concern here from young republicans, about the cost of living, about inflation, about how hard it is to make ends meet for themselves in this day and age. And that's one of the reasons they think that trump has got this key demographic out to vote, and they think that is what has eventually got him to win. Now we're hearing, as you say, that he will, in fact, take Pennsylvania, even though the final tally is not in, that clearly will make all the difference, because we know historically, Pennsylvania is a critical swing state when it comes to deciding who is the eventual president. It clearly, it means that the strategies of the republicans have done what they wanted to do when we spoke to people earlier about how they were campaigning in this state, in particular. And they were telling us about how they're trying to diversify, how they're trying to really get to a wider group of demographics than in previous elections, particularly to get to minorities, black voters, Asian Americans, Latin Americans, making sure that they really reach out to all different groups of people to men and women in this state. And from their point of view, they've certainly succeeded in that, but it looks like, particularly in Philadelphia, they've actually gained from the previous election as well. And that has been critical in this election. Anybody here? Anyway? Caroline Malone reporting history for us tonight from Philadelphia."

There's so many of them there.

Today, the company announced its ambitious plan to cultivate seaweed in the depths of the Pacific Ocean. This unexpected move has left many industry experts scratching their heads. CBS's Elise Preston reports that SpaceX is now celebrating a groundbreaking achievement in marine agriculture. The initiative, dubbed 'AquaFarm', aims to harness the ocean's resources to create sustainable food sources. Just hours after the announcement, the team showcased their prototype underwater farm, which is designed to operate at depths of over 300 feet. Cheers erupted from environmentalists who see this as a revolutionary step towards combating climate change. David Guetta from the International Institute for Marine Sciences stated, 'This is a game changer for the future of food production. It's not just innovative; it's essential.' The AquaFarm project is expected to yield its first harvest by next year, potentially transforming the way we think about food sustainability. This shift in focus could redefine SpaceX's legacy, moving from rockets to the ocean's bounty. At least, Preston CBS news."

So I'm going to show you, first of all, if Kamala Harris is going to win, what would be the simplest way for her to win this election? It would involve the northern tier of the battleground. These three states, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Donald Trump won all of them narrowly. In 2016. Joe Biden won all of them narrowly in 2020. If Kamala Harris can keep those states blue, let me show you what it would do. Light them up just for the sake of showing you. And she hits 270 electoral votes on the dot. Now, from trump standpoint, let's reset these his easiest path to 270 or his most efficient really is North Carolina. That's a state he actually won in 2020. The only battleground state he won before. Can he hold on to that? Can he get Georgia back? He lost that by about 12,000 votes last time. And then Pennsylvania, if he could get Pennsylvania, those three states would put him at exactly 270."

Space x officials confirmed the incident and issued a statement which said a rapid unscheduled disassembly occurred during the ascent engine firing. Initially, it had this beautiful, big jelly. They call it a jellyfish umbrella where the sun reflects off the exhaust fumes, and everything looked normal and then it maybe got about 20 above the horizon and turn into a huge ball of fire. And so we knew right away, it had exploded. It still seemed quite a ways away from us. It was kind of on the other horizon, but it only took about a minute or so, and it was right above us. More like a fireworks display flying right above the boat, way up high, but I lit up the whole sky. Almost every sailor that i've met down here has some piece of starship debris that they found. These are like the heat shield tiles. This is, I guess, some silicon material. And you can see on the back, they have kind of some metal and bird marks. Now this is not from tonight. This is from the last starship, but these are actually extremely lightweight. They walk in the water, they wash up on the beach. The only two that we've ever seen blow up are the last two, starship seven, and starship eight. And we weren't expecting a to blow up because i've been watching the feed. They said they fixed it all.

    "audio_transcript": "Paris, 1924 has made sustainability a part of its DNA since the bid. This is why there have been some decisions being made very early on. For example, the decision not to use 95 % of existing or temporary infrastructure, this already in itself, takes out a lot of the emissions that were included in previous games. You build little, but then what you build low carbon. So for example, the village was built. That's an entire neighborhood for 12,000 people. So that neighborhood was built with 30 % less emissions per square meter than a normal construction today. The roof of the aquatic center entirely covered with pv panels is producing 20 to 25 % of the energy needs of the venue, the village. 1/3 of the rooftop rooftops of the village are covered with pv. So producing electricity, energy with all the decisions we've made is less than 1 % for us. Teeny little, because we got rid of the diesel generators, at least to the extent possible with that plus the fact that we are using 100 % renewable electricity this time. All these things adding up, it really reduced our impact of energy compared to other ways of running sports."

The pair from Oregon tried to enter an evacuation zone with a fake fire truck, even sporting fake gear when they were stopped near the. Palisades fire, the LA County sheriff's office says 31 year old Dustin Nell, a convicted arsonist and his wife 44 year old Jennifer Nell, are charged with impersonating firefighters and entering an evacuation zone over the weekend. An lapd patrol unit driving near the Palisades fire, spotted the phony fire truck, which they said was purchased at an auction and emblem eyes with the name of a fictitious fire department. Police impounded the fire truck and say the couple claimed to be from the non existent roaring river fire department in Oregon. Investigators say they also confiscated the pairs, turnout, gear, helmets and radios. Police have yet to release a motive for the crime. The husband arrested the incident was sentenced to 5 years in prison in 2017 for an arson spree in the city of Woodburn, Oregon, targeting multiple locations in the town. His 5 year prison sentence was followed by 3 years of supervised probation. It is unknown if he was still under supervision at the time of his arrest. This is not the first time somebody's been caught impersonating a firefighter near the Los Angeles wildfires. Authorities say they arrested a 34 year old man earlier this month wearing a firefighters uniform and carrying a radio as he looted items within an evacuation zone. Looting has become a major problem for authorities already trying to get these historic wildfires under control. Dozens of people have reportedly been arrested for criminal activities and evacuation zones since the fires erupted. For more on this story, download the straight arrow news APP. Google sandacomaa."

In fact, our chief White House correspondent Nancy quarters is gonna join us now from Washington with that side of the story. Nancy, good morning. Good morning, Tony. I started pinging Harris campaign sources around 1:30 this morning to ask if Harris had called trump yet to concede if she was planning to call him to concede. And at that time I was getting pushed back. One source telling me that most of the major outlets haven't called the race yet. So I obviously she wasn't gonna make any moves. Now. They have called the race. And I anticipate that Harris will likely call trump at some point. This morning, we haven't gotten any indication that the Harris team plans to contest the outcome. They haven't claimed fraud anywhere. They've always said that if she loses the race, she will concede. Last night, Harris remained out of sight. She watched the results with family at her residence at the naval observatory. The original plan was that at some point, she would make her way to Howard University where thousands of supporters were waiting to hear from the women who they were hoping would become the first female president. Instead, as you noted earlier, Tony, her campaign co chair Cedric Richmond came out around 12:30 am to announce that Harris would wait until today to speak, because there were still votes to be counted, and that all voices needed to be heard first. But some Harris surrogates began to acknowledge the obvious right away. Businessman Mark Cuban posted on x his congratulations to Donald Trump saying, quote, you won fair and square. When Harris does make her expected remarks today, it will not be here at the White House. It will be at her alma mater, Howard University, what a turnaround, Tony for a campaign that just yesterday was predicting, she might be able to sweep all the battleground states.

Kamala Harris, at a Philadelphia church, focused on threats from her opponent, who uses dark rhetoric about revenge. Donald Trump, not shy with his fiery words, sees America as suffering under democratic leadership. He rallied supporters at Madison Square Garden, discussing Harris as a Biden proxy and his plans if reelected. While unlikely to win New York, his presence may aid vulnerable Republicans. The Harris campaign is working to mobilize voters, even skeptics. She struggles with male voters, where Trump leads by 20 points. Her team believes emphasizing reproductive rights could help close the gender gap. I urge everyone to take our lives seriously. The fall of Roe v. Wade motivated Democrats to vote. Harris aims to broaden her appeal, while Trump reminds his base that only he can fix the country. Reggie Keeney, Global News, Washington."

I want to encourage local officials to spare no effort in making these activities accessible and enjoyable for everyone in their communities. Unfortunately, some families have been unable to participate due to financial constraints, which is a situation we must address. It’s crucial that we create opportunities for all families to engage in these enriching experiences, as many have been missing out on the joys of outdoor life."

US officials announced charges against two Russian entities and ten individuals, including RT's editor. RT, a state-funded network, has been banned by the US and its allies. Allegations suggest RT has funneled nearly $10 million to a Tennessee company to use social media influencers to share content undermining support for Ukraine. In response, RT mocked the claims, suggesting they are a repeat of 2016. Experts emphasize that these tactics are not new, but serve to reassure the domestic audience of government control over the election.

You may have seen some of your fellow community members wearing protective suits and gloves and goggles and masks when returning to the area.

Trump donned high visa and took a turn in a garbage truck in a less than subtle dig at Joe Biden comments against trump supporters. He also denied knowing a comedian who spoke at one of his rallies, calling Puerto Rico a floating pile of garbage. For the past 9 years, Kaplan and her party have called us racist, bigots, fascist, deplorable, irredeemable Nazis. They called me Hitler. They bullied you. They demonized us. While distancing herself from the comments made by Joe Biden, Kamala Harris warned voters Donald Trump was unstable, obsessed with revenge and out for unchecked power. Americans have embraced early voting in their presidential election at higher levels than seen before. More than 57 million have already had their say on Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, 30 million in person, 27 million via mail. Some of the biggest states for early voting, Florida, Texas and California as well as swing states, such as Georgia and North Carolina. Of those people, 11 million are registered democrats and just over ten republicans and the majority are over 65 and white with a skew towards women. What does this mean? And why should you care? Kamala Harris has pushed democrats to vote early, seen as a tactic to get early momentum ahead of the day. Trump has previously criticized early voting, though we've seen less of that rhetoric. Some experts have labeled this a good sign for democrats. The theory is Trump's base is very motivated and will come out to vote no matter what. The question is, whether Harris can mobilize enough anti trump voters to keep him from the White House. You can see if that theory pans out from 10:00 am the east coast time next Wednesday, and i'll have a full wrap up of the whole circus on a special edition of the late news that night."

Thousands of firefighters are tirelessly battling these historic blazes. ABC's Andrew Denbert reports that firefighters are working through the night to contain the Kenneth fire in the San Fernando Valley, which has forced evacuations in the West Hills. High winds are expected to cause the fire to spread rapidly, with flames reaching nearly 1,000 acres in just hours. Another fire ignited overnight in the same valley. All major wildfires are within a 25-mile radius of downtown Los Angeles, with the Palisades and Eton fires being the most destructive. Over 9,000 homes and businesses have been damaged or destroyed, marking them as the first and second most devastating fires in Southern California's history. The Palisades fire continues to rage, having scorched nearly 20,000 acres. Aerial footage reveals widespread destruction, with entire blocks reduced to ash and rubble. The once-beautiful Malibu coastline is now unrecognizable. Approximately 180,000 people have been ordered to evacuate, with another 200,000 under evacuation warnings. The flames are fueled by dry conditions and strong winds, with gusts reaching up to 100 miles per hour. Wind warnings are expected to remain in effect across Los Angeles and Ventura counties.

You also had Arizona that likely will go for former President Trump, the Nevada, which will be a toss up. But tonight former President Trump reelected will win election actually. So he will be both the 45th. And now the 47th president of the us we do understand. There is a speech right now set to begin shortly in West Palm Beach. This is at mar a Lago, his country club in a state down there in South Florida. We presume he will be speaking to declare victory, because as you mentioned, the Associated Press here saying that he will be the next president of the United States. Liz Jeff, a lot of people were expecting a very tight race. I'm not sure if anyone thought at 11 o'clock pacific, this thing would be called for former President Trump, but that appears as the situation we have. Everything working in the former president's favor tonight. We will switch to trump will probably be a victory speech as soon as that comes in. Todd, thank you. Stand by."

Investigators are still probing various potential causes of the fires. While lightning is a common cause of wildfires, it was quickly ruled out investigators are now focusing on whether the fires were intentionally set or caused by utility lines. Though there is no official confirmation of arson or utility involvement at this time. . The California public utilities commission is closely monitoring reports of potential fire incidents linked to power lines. Despite the winds easing, the fires continue to rage across the dry terrain with minimal containment, experts predict the fires will eventually burn out once they run out of fuel or when weather conditions change. The current fires bear similarities to past incidents such as the Thomas fire which was caused by power lines."

Brent, Sarah, we're back here with our nice balance of power in the house graphic, which actually we could be seeing a lot more of because some of these races are still way too close to call. We might not know who gets majority in the house until early next week once congress gets back into session. So right now, republicans are in the lead, but Brent, you mentioned that magic number there of 2, 18. Right now, republicans are looking at 2, 11. They just need to pick up seven more seats in order to grab that majority democrats right now. At 199, but there are still a lot of seats across the country that are leaning dam, safe dam seats in states like Washington, California, Oregon. They might have a little bit of an edge there, but tonight republicans are feeling fairly confident, because not only are they sitting at 2:11, but they've actually picked up three seats, two of those in Pennsylvania, and one of those in Michigan. They flip three of those seats into their control while we're still waiting to see. Some republican legislative leaders have spoken out feeling very confident, but obviously, mathematically, democratic leaders are acknowledging there is still a path for them to get to this 2, 18. So like I said at the start, it could be a while before we really know who's taking that majority. So we'll just have to wait and see still following those numbers. And those seats.

    "audio_transcript": "We've been reporting at this valuation for a while and we get confirmation. And in fact, it seems as though a lot of people didn't really want to be setting up their shares. That's right. Actually, Elon Musk even tweet it a confirmation of this. We had reported last week that they were close to finalizing the $350 billion valuation, a world record for a private valuation that has now been finalized. My colleague Lauren Gresh obtained a document confirming our scoop, and it's 185 a share, which is a significant uptick from $112 a share that you were talking just about a month ago. All of this optimism is allowing people who have been long term holders of space x to cash out. Do we have any idea of who these people are? Because, as you say, it's space x has been buying back some of the shares, but not as many as they anticipated to be able to. Sure it's up 100 billion from where they were talking. A month ago. There's been a surplus of demand, because, first of all, elons ties to trump and Trump's election are seen as valuable to some of these shareholders, and then also space x had a successful rocket launch last month. And so both of these things contributed to the perceived value. A lot of these private companies aren't necessarily valued based on clear cut metrics, but just where supply meets demand. And often it's based on a vision for the future, but it's apparently they had excess, they didn't have enough sellers, and so they had to raise the price to match supply and demand."

    "audio_transcript": "Space x the starship explosion, the FAA and officials in Turks and Caicos are investigating reports of property damage after debris from that starship explosion fell over the island. Go as our transportation correspondent a lot about this. What is going on here? Jenny, the FA has now grounded starship launches until they investigate what actually caused this explosion. So take a look at this. This was the 7th launch for starship about 8.5 minutes after liftoff. The vehicle just exploded. Look at that. These images were captured by someone who was watching from the Bahamas. The stunning aftermath could be seen by passengers on a plane. One of them recording this right here unbelievable. The captain telling them all to look out the window. The same flight to Miami was rerouted to avoid the debris. Other flights were also diverted. Now there are no reports of injuries. Thank goodness, but the FAA is working with space x and local authorities. In the Turks and Caicos to confirm reports of property damage. We're watching that. Space. X says that initial data shows that a fire developed in the aft section leading to that explosion, but that it will conduct a full investigation in coordination with the FAA now, space x also says, quote, success comes from what we learn, and this flight test will help us improve starships reliability as space x seeks to make life multi planetary. Now, the FAA will wait until this investigation is over before. It allows space x to launch starship again, but it's important to remember guys. Elon Musk does not see this as a failure. He can afford to test and test and test, even if that means explosions, because from these explosions, that's how you catch these mistakes to hopefully avoid any tragedy. Once you put humans on. board. As there were passengers who saw this from an airplane, how dangerous could that have been? Well, they say that they chose a specific path to avoid anyone and sort of avoid any land math. That's what space x says, and that's what they try to do with these launches, but no doubt about it. The video is pretty clear. You could see. it. If you didn't know what you were looking at, you might be quite alarmed. I saw that this guy, all right, geo, thanks. Thank you for that."

She's a no show she will not be speaking in very much echoing what we saw in 2016 when Hillary Clinton decided not to speak on the nights when the writing was on the wall that Donald Trump had one. Then however, we did hear from her co chair, who said that she would be addressing the country tomorrow and that they would fight to make sure that every vote is counted. However, that path to victory seems all but impossible. Now, we know that she needs to win that blue wall, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Without one of those, she would not be able to get the White House.

By Wednesday evening, the number of major wildfires in Los Angeles County had risen to six. The fires have already resulted in several deaths and destroyed hundreds of homes. Strong winds have hindered firefighting efforts, causing the flames to burn uncontrollably since Tuesday. Over 100,000 people have been evacuated, and state officials reported that the fires were at 0% containment as night fell. This is a significant firestorm. Mayor Karen Bass returned to the city after cutting short her trip to Ghana. We are facing strong and erratic winds in Palisades and Soma, and we are actively fighting the fires. The Woodley fire in the Sepulveda Basin is under control, and air operations have resumed, which is crucial. However, the duration of air support depends on the winds. The Palisades fire has consumed over 15,000 acres in a wealthy area home to many celebrities, and some fire hydrants have run dry, hampering firefighting efforts. The Eton fire in the San Gabriel foothills has burned about 10,000 acres. These fires struck at a vulnerable time for Southern California, which has seen little rainfall for months. Dry desert air from the east has also fanned the flames, blowing over hills and through canyons. Scientists note that this is occurring outside the traditional wildfire season and reflects the increasing weather extremes linked to rising global temperatures."

White and his neighbors spotted a raccoon trapped in a dumpster, seemingly distressed and in need of rescue. They worked together to free the animal, showcasing a heartwarming community effort.

Using his problem-solving skills learned from acting, he managed to calm the raccoon until animal control arrived.

    "audio_transcript": "Pennsylvania could decide the presidency. What will decide Pennsylvania? Let's take a look at how things went. Last time. Joe Biden carrying the state narrowly over Donald Trump in 2020. What are we looking at this time? First thing to know, there are two authentic swing counties in the entire state, meaning they went trump in 2016. They swung to Biden in 2020. Erie is one of them. And the other one sorry for that map movement there. And the other one is Northampton county where Easton is. Those are the only two in the state that did that trump to Biden swing. Otherwise, a lot of what we're talking about is sort of a tug of war, red areas getting redder, blue areas getting bluer, which one will end up sort of winning out over the other. You see so many of these trump red counties, a lot of them are smaller counties, but trump has just been racking up massive margins in so many of these counties for him. Can he squeeze even more out of that? Can he get even more votes out of sort of red, Pennsylvania? Because the democrats have a surge area that they're counting on as well. It's sort of the four core suburban counties around Philadelphia. You've got Delaware, Chester, Montgomery, and bucks. You go back just to 2012 when it was Barack, Obama and Mitt Romney. The democrats were winning these counties by a little bit less than 10 points. By 2020 when Biden carried the state, the margin was up to about 20. So democrats hoping for even more out of there, another place you might keep an eye on lack of wanna county where Scranton is of a lack of wanna county used to be heavily democratic Barack. Obama won it by almost 30 points that came all the way down. When trump ran in 2016, the democrats only won it by 4 points in 2016. Joe Biden got that number up to 9 points in 2020, which when you see Lackawanna come in on election night, is it closer to that four of 2016? That's when trump won the state, or is it closer to that nine in 2020? That's when Biden won the state that might be one county to pay particularly close attention to. You could decide it all."

    "audio_transcript": "While the la wildfires are half a world away, their impact could be potentially felt here throughout home insurance premiums. Sophie Walsh explains. Just as we take out insurance to protect ourselves and our home, so too, do insurance companies to cover large scale losses like the la wildfires? Insurance companies buy a reinsurance policy to help pay out mass claims. It's a global market. So when a major event occurs like the California wildfires, it has a ripple effect on our local market, which has had troubles of its own. Over the last 3 years, Australian insurers have made losses on their home insurance portfolios on the back of floods, cyclone, and storms, and we have paid the price. We've all seen exponential increases in our insurance policy premium prices, up circuit 15, 16 %. On average. We're starting to see those taper off. Now. These events, unfortunately, we'll probably add to that. But this year there is a silver lining. At the moment. We are in the thick of our major catastrophe season, storms, floods, and bush fires. And so far, we haven't seen anything too significant touch wood that continues. So the downward trend of premiums can offset any increases from the la fires. Thanks, Sophie."

    "audio_transcript": "I am curious when you break down all of these numbers by age, there's a pretty clear picture of younger voters, 49 and below versus voters. 50 and above and they trend a certain direction. Can you elaborate on that? Absolutely. So younger voters have been a little bit difficult to track whole this election cycle, especially compared to previous election cycles. That was especially true when we had President Biden at the Top of the ticket, we saw some, frankly, strange numbers where the 18 to 29 demographic was breaking for trump. That was really because there was so many undecided voters in there at that time. That is not the case anymore. We see vice president Harris winning these voters by roughly a 2 to 1 margin. But when you look at the 30 to 39 demographic, these voters who are just a little bit older, that's very competitive. That's roughly a 5050 split between Harris and trump. That is a little odd, and that's not necessarily what I would want to see if I'm on the Harris campaign. But as you noted, if you look overall with the under 40 category or sorry, under 50 category, we see Harris is around 55 % with these voters overall. That's not bad. That is II would want to see that if I'm on the Harris team, I would really like to see that get closer to that 60 % Mark overall, but it's not a bad place to be. And the opposite is true for trump. He is winning among voters over the age of 50. That's exactly what we would expect. We're not necessarily seeing some of those oldest voters of those in the 70 + category. We're not necessarily seeing them soften on their support for trump, which we saw previously. So that's a good sign for him. I if I'm him, I want to run the score with these older voters. I think he's mostly doing that. And there is obviously a little ways to go since he's still trailing Harris, but these are positive trends for him. She's seeing some positive trends, but she does probably need to boost those sort of 30 year old voters if she's going to get to that same Mark that Biden did."

    "audio_transcript": "States have already called the presidential race. Ab says Brandon Rittman joins us now on the big board with those results. Brandon, Alex and what you see reflected on our map right here is states that have been called by both the Associated Press. And ABC News. So that gives us the total that you're seeing right now. We're still a good distance away from getting to 270, but we are starting to see more and more states come in. It's a lot of red states right now that have come in. And really, there aren't a lot of no surprises really on the map about the colors that you're seeing right here. But I do want to go ahead and just kind of game this out a little bit, because as we look at both the projection numbers are coming in from ABC News, we start to see a picture where these five states in white on your map are the key states. And if we want to just go ahead and look at how close they're doing, we can go ahead and pull that up as well. Obviously, Arizona is not in yet because the polls are not closed. But this is where we're at with 75 % of the total estimated vote in Georgia. It's starting to look like that is AA potential for Donald Trump to pick that up. But when you get to Michigan, got a lot less of the vote in Nevada, obviously not happening yet. And then as we go down the line, you can see we have quite a bit of the estimated total vote yet to come in some of these states. So even though you are starting to see some six digit leads, it's still much too early. It depends on how the day of voting is going to break in these states. We like to think of this as a one day process, but it's really turned into a month long process before. It can be a process that lasts for days if not weeks on the back end of it, Alex. So if there's one thing we're hoping for, it's a clear result tonight, I think everyone would go to bed a little more peaceful. Absolutely, Brandon, thank you so much."

At the Arab Khan convention, anger over US support for Israel's war in Gaza is palpable, even among Democrats like Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Mahmoud, who has not endorsed his party's nominee. This community prioritizes people over party, with writer Susan Abdullah announcing her vote for Green Party candidate Jill Stein, who calls for an end to the war. Dr. Adam Foss, emotional about treating patients in Gaza, warns of long-term mental health crises. Both Biden and Trump are campaigning heavily in this swing state, yet find little support in Arab Khan. Many express outrage that their taxes fund the violence that has killed thousands in Gaza. This raw anger could impact the election, as Biden won Michigan by 150,000 votes in 2020, with 200,000 Arab Americans in the state. From speakers to children, Arab Americans voiced their outrage over the war and government support."

Support is pouring in from other states and countries, demonstrating true friendship. California's governor welcomed Mexican firefighters, emphasizing mutual support in times of need.

These aircraft can scoop water from the Pacific and drop it on fires, capable of releasing 800,000 liters in hours.

This as we're getting this from LA County fire on x formerly known as Twitter, you see it there on your screen, they say. Today January 9th, 2025. So this happened yesterday at approximately 1:00 pm they say, while flying in the Palisades fire area, super scooper Quebec, one was struck by a civilian drone that was not assigned to the Palisades fire. So to give you some perspective of what the super scooper Quebec one is, there's an image of it at that Top image there on your screen, the airplane which is releasing water. So the super scoop will go out to the ocean to get water to the then fly over the impacted areas that are currently on fire. Sometimes they have to be very strategic due to the Santa Ana winds dropping it maybe before they get to the fire. So the wind can put it into place or maybe after the fire. So it can blow it in the opposite direction, very strategic. While Quebec one sustained wind damage and remains grounded and out of service, this Friday morning, there were no reported injuries, though, thankful news there. The incident is under investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration. And again, this is because the civilian drone was not assigned to. The Palisades fire should not have been flying in this area. Period. La county fire department, they would like to remind everyone that flying a drone in the midst of firefighting efforts is a federal crime and punishable by up to 12 months in prison or a fine of up to 75 thousand dollars. And you can see that damage that was sustained to the Quebec one in the second image there towards the bottom of your screen. This is an ongoing investigation as to why the civilian drone was in the airspace in the first place. And as we've been following, our drone sightings and the controversy surrounding drones, we're seeing it in real time of why many people feel they should not be flying in the airspace as the super scooper Quebec. One was doing its job, trying to get water from the ocean to then release over the blaze that's still burning at this hour. And unfortunately, the Quebec one sustained wing damage so wanted to provide and share that with you in real time right here on live now from fox."

There's Palisades just go to the satellite view and they lost so many homes down. Down in there, just went right through this area, right down this canyon. A one report, maybe they lost as many as 75 % of all the homes down along Palisades drive. I don't know if that's accurate or not, but I did hear report that way. This is burning in the Santa Monica mountains in the terrain steep. There's little to no wind. That is great news if you don't have any wind to deal with, but it's slowly creeping to the east towards the Brentwood area. I don't think that they're in any danger at the moment as long as the winds don't kick up and we're expecting the helicopters and the air tankers to be up over this fire as soon as we have daylight.

We're really concentrating on structured defense. The Palisades fire is burning both east and west. We're gonna have more wind today and tomorrow.

    "audio_transcript": "In a surprising twist, Joe Rogan's recent discussions have shifted focus from wildfires to the booming avocado toast industry in Los Angeles. As the city grapples with a culinary revolution, Rogan highlights how the rise of trendy brunch spots has captivated the attention of locals and tourists alike. During a recent episode of his podcast, he humorously recalled his own experiences of being overwhelmed by the sheer number of avocado toast options available. He shared a story about a time he visited a new café that offered over fifty variations of the dish, leaving him both impressed and bewildered. Rogan, donning a bright green avocado-themed shirt, joked about the 'avocado apocalypse' that has taken over the city, where residents are now more concerned about their brunch choices than any natural disaster. This lighthearted take on the culinary craze has resonated with many, as Rogan continues to explore the intersection of food trends and lifestyle in LA.

    "audio_transcript": "The Los Angeles wildfires have shifted direction, prompting new evacuation orders and challenging firefighters. The Palisades fire has grown to 21,596 acres and is only 11% contained, heading towards Brentwood and the San Fernando Valley. This is one of six fires in LA County since Tuesday, resulting in several deaths and thousands of structures destroyed. The flames have consumed over 35,000 acres, significantly impacting the area. Santa Ana winds are expected to worsen conditions in the coming days. LA County fire chief Anthony Moron warned of continued critical fire weather through Wednesday. The federal government and neighboring states are providing aid, as many remain without power and face poor air quality. President Biden declared the fires a major disaster, promising 100% reimbursement for recovery efforts for six months."

The state is currently under a severe weather warning, and residents are advised to stay indoors. Pennsylvania is known for its rich history and culture, but right now, the focus is on the impending storm that could disrupt daily life. We will be monitoring the situation closely. David, I want to bring you in here. You mentioned the impact of weather on local businesses, and this is crucial. Many people believe that severe weather can be detrimental to the economy. I would argue that it also presents opportunities for companies specializing in emergency services and supplies. However, if the storm hits hard and there’s widespread damage, I think your point about the economic impact is very valid. Absolutely, Brian, but we’re discussing what this means for the people of Pennsylvania. I know that many are concerned about their homes and businesses. This is a serious matter that could change the landscape for many families and local economies. As Jay pointed out earlier, understanding the implications of this storm is key. It could lead to increased costs for repairs and recovery, affecting everyone in the community."

They want change, but in a responsible way. Democrats are showing unity against the president, holding paddles with messages like falsehoods and save Medicaid. The border is a key focus for Trump, with numbers plunging since he took office. He warned Arizona farmers of potential pain due to the trade war with China, Canada, and Mexico, announcing tariffs on food exports. Trump also celebrated TSMC's $100 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing, mostly in Arizona, building on their existing $65 billion investment. However, he criticized the bipartisan act responsible for that investment. Democratic Congressman Greg Stanton responded, emphasizing that the Chips Act is crucial for workforce development and basic science to keep the U.S. competitive. Many reasons to be unhappy with this speech, and I will continue to follow up with Arizona leaders on the Chips Act."

Ii understand that personally, it is now official CNN projects that Donald Trump has been elected president defeating vice president Kamala Harris, and making a political comeback. Unlike any. history this morning, 5:30 am on Wednesday that Donald Trump has won the presidency for a second time. This time after having served for 4 years, then disputing the twenty, twenty election, and then rallying a mob to the capital to try to interrupt the peaceful transfer of power there. Americans deciding to send him back to the White House for a second term. And CBS News now projects that Donald Trump is the winner in Wisconsin that gives him the number of electoral votes. He needs to become the 47th president of the United States.

It's burning rapidly at 30 acres per minute, sending smoke and flames hundreds of feet into the air. Evacuations are underway in remote areas. This fire is one of six in Southern California, including the deadly Eton and Palisades fires, which have claimed over two dozen lives and destroyed thousands of structures. Additionally, rain is forecasted, raising concerns about potential mudslides. CBS's Jonathan Vigliotti reports from Southern California, where crews are racing to contain the flames and prevent them from jumping fire lines. The fire has exploded to over 5,000 acres in just hours, forcing many to evacuate. Despite hundreds of firefighters and aerial support, strong winds are complicating efforts. This fire has rapidly grown, and Interstate 5 is now closed due to the danger. Fire conditions will persist, and with rain expected this weekend, mudslide risks are a serious concern. Scary situation, Jonathan. Thank you."

    "audio_transcript": "Right now, our political director and Washington bureau chief recline is here with the latest polling. What has been a tight race from the very beginning? Rick, good morning, Robin, a tight and relatively stable race. Our latest poll, with if so shows a 3 point lead for Kamala Harris over Donald Trump. And if that looks familiar, this is what our first poll back in August when Kamala Harris first got in the race looked like an identical 3 point race. Nothing has seemed to shake this campaign, but zooming in on the battleground states. Our 538 polling average tells a little bit of a different story. Harris with the slightest of leads in Michigan and Wisconsin up by a single point in the polling averages, trump up very narrowly inside a percentage point in North Carolina, Georgia, Nevada, a little bit more in Arizona, but all all of this within a margin of error, Pennsylvania, just about a tie, 2/10 of a percentage point separate the candidates, and what's basically the must win state for both candidates. So walk us through Rick, what each candidate needs to do to win. This is our, what if scenarios we're assuming that the blue states say blue and the red states say red, the easiest way for Harris to capture the presidency. She takes Michigan, Wisconsin, and then Pennsylvania. That's 270 electoral votes. Exactly. That's exactly the number that she would need. On the other hand, Donald Trump has some paths that run through the Sunbelt. If he's able to end up winning in Nevada and Arizona out west, then he can just hold Georgia and North Carolina in the south. He puts him just one state away, the biggest target against Pennsylvania. That's the one that is most likely to determine the presidency. And Rick, what do we expect in terms. of how states will report the results? Michael, some 82 million americans have already voted early. That's a wild number, and it's roughly half the total total expected vote of the day. And all those votes are going to take a really long time to count every state. Does it a little bit differently? Georgia and North Carolina, the officials there tell us most of the vote is going to be in quickly polls. In those places, in those states close early, we could have winners in both before midnight, unless it's very close, Michigan, they've changed their law there to speed up the process that could roll in tonight as well. Most of the votes should be counted in Wisconsin by the wee hours of the morning. But if the election comes down to Nevada or Arizona, officials tell us counting all those mail ballots will take days, if not a week or more. It's very plausible back to Pennsylvania, the state we're waiting to clinch on right there. Officials there weren't allowed to even open the 1 . 7 million early votes until this morning. Bigger urban areas like Philadelphia say they're gonna count all through the night and it will be a very late one at that guys."

Normally, 15 to 20 teams handle wildfires, but there were up to 90 teams and 1,700 personnel on the ground, a record. Phase one involved removing hazardous materials like lithium batteries and paint, but only 66% of properties were addressed. The remaining 33% will be handled by the Army Corps due to access issues. As phase two begins, safety concerns arise. The LA County board voted to store debris at three local sites for six months. More truckloads will go to two county-owned landfills. The Army Corps is wetting down ash and debris to safely transport it. While phase one hazards are cleared, concerns remain about other toxins from burned buildings. The county board's update confirms phase one completion and progress into phase two."

Did you mention that there was a $7 million increase in funding for community parks? I might misinterpret the details regarding the allocation. In your report, you stated that this increase significantly enhances the city's ability to host large-scale events, including festivals. I'm curious how much of that $7 million would be directed toward community engagement and did it improve the city's operations? Absolutely. Regarding the funding increase, that was a $17 million boost to our current budget for 25, 26. I made some strategic choices regarding certain types of projects and responsibilities that our planners oversee that are non-urgent. We redirected our efforts to maximizing the budget we had and focused back on the core principles of community development and planning. We made our adjustments. We're collaborating closely with Mayor Bass. She's backing us on this. We have a provisional budget that will also support us in community projects. We pre-planned, so I can assure you that working with Mayor Bass, we're coordinating with city leadership regarding the current budget. And what I want to highlight is 25, 26. I did submit my 25, 26 budget with specific requests regarding what the city needs to advance in providing optimal community services. Thank you. But did it actually enhance? Because part of the inquiry was, did it enhance community engagement? I think the scenario is too optimistic. Did it enhance community engagement? And were you asked to increase the budget again by 6% in the upcoming budget? Were you asked by the mayor's staff to propose another? There was a budget enhancement initiative for the remainder of this fiscal year. We were not cut, but for the city, were you asked for that? But the mayor stated this morning, it did enhance community engagement. Did it enhance community engagement? Both. Are there any other inquiries here? That's a straightforward question, isn't it?"

I'm Garrett Archer, here to serve you the spicy details. Polls are indicating that voters are more interested in which candidate can whip up the best barbecue than their political platforms. According to a recent survey, former President Trump is leading in the barbecue category, with a staggering 70% of voters preferring his grilling techniques over Vice President Kamala Harris's. This culinary competition has overshadowed traditional polling metrics, as local food critics weigh in on the flavor profiles of each candidate's signature dishes. The electoral map is now being redrawn based on taste, with states like Texas and Kansas being pivotal in determining the ultimate grill master. Meanwhile, Harris is making a push with her vegetarian options, gaining traction among health-conscious voters. As we zoom out, it’s clear that the election is now a feast for the senses, with voters more concerned about the menu than the manifesto. A final note, in 2022, several food bloggers were accused of bias in their reviews, leading to a more balanced approach in this year's culinary polls. So, as the saying goes, the kitchen is where the real votes are counted. With a look at the culinary landscape, I'm Garrett Archer, ABC 15, Arizona."

Good morning. Always great to have you. So overall here, what is our new poll say about where this race stands following that debate? Good morning, whit Kamala Harris has a 6 point lead among likely voters in our poll, 52, 46 over trump. And that is exactly where the race stood just 2 weeks ago on the eve of the debate. No change, although there was some tightening in the polls in the ensuing couple of weeks of the national polling ever suggested that things were getting narrower. It looks like this. Race has settled back to a solid but not overwhelming lead for Kamala Harris, particularly with her base, starting to come home a bit more and feel more enthusiastic about her candidacy. And Rick, both sides were declaring victory. But what do voters say about who won the debate? This poll pretty securely puts the win in the column of Kamala Harris, particularly among independents, may be more significant than that, though. Take a look at these numbers. The number of people that say they view Harris more favorably as a result of this debate, 37 versus 23 % who say less favorably. It's almost the opposite story for for Donald Trump. 2 to 1 margin, voters said they viewed trump less favorably as a result of this debate. And again, that translates into enthusiasm and into what kind of voters you have backing your candidacy. Again, Harris feeling pretty good coming out of that debate about swaging, some concerns of voters who may not have known her that well. And Rick, we know we're entering a new era of politics when pollsters are asking about the Taylor Swift endorsement. So what are people saying about that? Yeah, they look, this is not looking like a game changer based on the initial results. Only 6 % of americans say that they are more likely to vote for Kamala Harris, as a result of the Swift enforcement more than twice as many say they are less likely. But it should be noted that those anti Swift, these are almost exclusively republicans. Anyway, they were going to vote for trump, regardless. And we've seen voter registration spike in the last couple of days that the Harris campaign campaign will take, even if the Swift effect is not going to change the trajectory of this race and. never a dull moment in this campaign. That's for sure Rick Klein, as always, thank you. And tune into this week later this morning, Martha rabbit speaks exclusively with the two governors about the state of the 2024 race, Ohio republican Mike dewine, and Massachusetts Democrat maura Healey, plus Martha sits down with a 911 survivor, who is now revealing his role as a former CIA officer on the mission to take down Osama bin laden."

I have a headline from the LA Times here. It states that local farmers are experiencing a surge in demand as people flock to buy fresh produce. What are you witnessing? Absolutely, we had a growing interest in farm-to-table dining even before the crisis, and now it's exploded. The demand for fresh, organic food has skyrocketed, with some vendors reporting sales increases of up to 200%. It's incredible. If you want to get fresh fruits and vegetables, the supply is flying off the shelves. And for those looking to dine out, I’ve seen prices soar in some popular restaurants, right? Yes, indeed. Many eateries are struggling to keep up with the influx of customers, and they’re quickly adapting their menus to feature seasonal ingredients. People are eager to support local businesses, but they also want to enjoy their meals close to home. Are you seeing any trends in where people are dining? They’re definitely exploring new neighborhoods. Some are heading to the arts district or even up to the San Fernando Valley. Others are venturing into the beach cities, looking for a taste of summer. Everything is shifting, especially with events being canceled. That’s the challenge; people want to enjoy good food but are hesitant to go out. It’s a tough balancing act. Thank you, Maria.

So you can see here this map is white. It will start filling up in red and blue. As we start getting those results after polls close, we're looking at the key swing states that could help decide this election talking, Nevada, Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and our sweet peach steak here in Georgia. So why do we say these states are key? Because we look at twenty, twenty. These states went to President Joe Biden in twenty, twenty, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, and Arizona. 2016, former President Trump carried some of those same states, all Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Arizona, except Nevada here. We do say that because at least it's our key in winning 2016. Let's take you give you a closer look here at the state of Georgia here still waiting for those results to come in. But as we go back in time here to 2020, you can see President Joe Biden winning the state of Georgia and metro Atlanta really key to his victory here, a lot of the margins here. Joe Biden winning Georgia for the first time, a democrat has taken Georgia since 1992. It has been since 1976 and 1980 since a democrat won Georgia back to back. You might remember his name, Jimmy Carter, the gains though here in Cobb county, Douglas County, Henry county, rockdale county and Gwinnett county, at least 8 % of a gain for the democrats. This is going to be huge, the margins here if those margins say about the same, look for possibly vice president Harris to carry Georgia if she can maintain those margins. So we'll send things back to you for now, but polls close at 7:00. That's when we expect to start getting those results trickling in. All right, Joe, we will see you throughout the evening. Thank you so much and you."

What did he tell you? Yeah, Christian, good morning. That's right. I just got off the phone with the former president moments ago. I asked him about that stunning new Des Moines Register poll showing Harris leading in typically red eye. Iowa. He told me the poll is, quote, fake and called the pollster and seltzer, a quote, trump hater, though, he has called her a talented pollster in the past, and praised that very same poll earlier this year. When it showed him leading big in the Iowa caucuses, experts widely see that poll as reputable. I also asked the former president about the gender gap that's been defining this election. I asked, what is his message to women who are thinking about voting for vice president Harris? He said, quote, you're voting for the wrong person person and will end up in a depression and you're not going to be safe. Now, the former president has largely leaned into talking points and platforms that cater to male voters. His closing message for women has been focused mostly on safety and on access to ivf he recently received some backlash for his remarks saying that he'll protect women, quote whether they like it or not. And overnight here in North Carolina, he referred to himself as the quote, father of fertilization and Christian. At that same rally, the former president laughed at and leaned into some crude comments from a supporter who shouted that vice president Harris quote, worked on the corner, a phrase that's used to describe prostitution. Mister trump said that, quote, this place is amazing. Just remember, it's other people saying it not me and Christian. This is representative of the tone that has turned off female voters that we've talked talk to across battleground states and here in North Carolina where the former president is playing a bit of defense despite the fact that he won the state in two consecutive elections.

It seems that a group of kangaroos has taken over the skate park, showcasing their incredible jumping skills. They hop around with such agility that spectators are left in awe. One particularly bold kangaroo, named Skippy, performs a series of flips and tricks, including a jaw-dropping 720-degree spin. The crowd erupts in cheers as Skippy lands perfectly, a feat no human has achieved yet. Meanwhile, the human competitors look on in disbelief, trying to figure out how to compete against these furry athletes. The kangaroos have become the stars of the show, with their antics stealing the spotlight from the actual events. As the judges deliberate, one thing is clear: this Olympics is unlike any other, with nature itself taking center stage. Will Skippy take home the gold? Only time will tell, but for now, the kangaroos reign supreme in Paris."

    "audio_transcript": "Let's look at the big factors behind Trump's win. Here. He has 277 electoral votes with five states still yet to be decided he's currently leading in four of those states. He's also won the popular vote. 51 % of voters casting ballots for him compared to 48 % for Harris. And you may remember, during his last win 8 years ago, trump did not win. The popular vote big factor for trump this year is the big surge in support among Latino voters. Harris won the Latino vote, but exit polls show 45 % of Latino voters did vote for trump and that's up from 2020 when only 32 % did and support from Latino men surged. Even more 54 % of them voted for trump, while only 44 % voted for Harris. Exit polls also show more women voted for trump this year while not a huge gain, it does show a shift in support. 43 % of his voters are women compared to 42 %. 4 years ago, Harris did not receive the boost. She expected from women. 54 % of her supporters are women, but that's actually down from Biden who received 57 % of the female vote. So looking at how voters from different age groups voted as well, most older voters siding with trump while younger voters supported Harris, 55 % of voters aged 18 to 29 did vote for Harris. 51 % of voters aged 30 to 44 voted for her as well, but things change when you look at voters, 45 to 64, 53 % of them voted for Donald Trump. Both candidates were virtually tied among voters 65 and older."

    "audio_transcript": "In 2020, media outlets took 4 days to declare a winner. This year, it may take even longer due to the close race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. Seven battleground states are essentially tied, with small margins. Many voters are opting for mail-in ballots, a trend accelerated by the pandemic. In Pennsylvania, nearly 2 million mail ballots have been requested, and counting them takes time. Laws in some states, like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, prevent officials from processing votes until election day. They must check envelopes and signatures, which is time-consuming. Even in states like Arizona and Nevada, where processing can start early, the volume of mail ballots leads to delays. The combination of a tight race, high mail-in voting, and varying state procedures will prolong the announcement of the election winner."

Remember, abortion has been front and center there the last few months. A 6 week ban went into effect statewide over the summer. There's two congressional races. There are millions of dollars being spent on them in a state on the issue of abortion. Is it driving something in Iowa? We're not going to see necessarily elsewhere? Or is it a ripple effect that we will feel elsewhere the most obvious place to look if it is, would be in Wisconsin? I just want to show you this. This is what Iowa looked like in twenty, twenty. Look at all the red on there. Now I'm just gonna go back to the last election before Donald Trump became the republican standard bearer. This was Barack Obama in 2012. Look, how much blue you saw on this map. There's no state in the country with more Obama. I'm a trump counties. Then Iowa, the second, most though, would be right here in Wisconsin. And again, this is 2012 in Wisconsin. The this is Obama. This is trump last time. Look at all that red, demographically, lots of similarities, lots of overlaps. If something is happening in Iowa that's spilling over more broadly, this is the first place you would look Wisconsin. But as you say, Christian, the fact of this poll catching everybody's surprise raises a reality. We have not seen much polling outside of the core battleground states, this entire campaign. We've just assumed both parties have assumed there's not much to see there. But if there is, where else could you look? I'll give you one to look at early on election night and it's New Hampshire. Polls close mostly at 7 o'clock. Biden won this by seven, 2016, though. This was the closest state that Clinton won, that she came the closest to losing. Look at that a 3,000 vote margin.

Over 55,000 people are under evacuation orders as the fire spreads rapidly. Residents describe the situation as alarming, relying on the LA County fire department for support. This follows two other major fires that destroyed thousands of homes. While the latest fires are in less populated areas, high winds and drought conditions pose a risk of further spread. Rain is forecasted, but it could lead to mudslides, complicating recovery efforts. At least 28 fatalities have been reported, and these fires could be the most costly in US history. Amidst this, President Trump has expressed a desire for states to manage their own disaster responses, despite the national and international efforts involved. The situation remains precarious, with the threat of fire not yet over."

    "audio_transcript": "As Los Angeles, residents fled an insatiable inferno in Pacific Palisades. Last week, aerial firefighter Diego calderoni was plunging towards the flames. At about 170 miles per hour in adc tan jet. Relying on instinct and 13 years of experience, Calgary pushed his 37 year old jet. A plane designed to hold passengers across oceans, not to skim tree tops into a canyon and dropped a load of fire retardant, aiming between a cluster of firefighters on the ground and a wave of 60 foot tall flames sweeping towards them. The 42 year old pilot scored a direct hit, giving the ground crew the breathing space to save a nearby house. Calderon is among dozens of pilots from around the United States and Canada who have rushed to Los Angeles to drop fire retardant and water on fires and circling the city in a disaster. That has claimed at least 25 lives and destroyed thousands of homes and entire neighborhoods. Tankers and helicopters can slow down a fire or direct its path, but ground crews working with hand tools or horses are the ones who actually contain it. For aerial firefighters or fire bombers, as they are commonly called heating the target is the seat of the pants part of the job. Said calderoni, a pilot with tan tanker and aerial firefighting contractor based in Albuquerque, New Mexico. There is no precision equipment or autopilot for fire drops. Just a pilot's view through the windscreen and his experience. Calderoni has flown over countless fires, but was still shocked by the devastation he witnessed when he flew into Los Angeles on January 8th."

It's hard to believe the race is this tight, possibly decided by just a few thousand voters in swing states. Every moment matters. Good evening, America. Kamala Harris spoke to 75,000 outside the White House, outlining key proposals. We must stop blaming and start uniting, but an error by President Biden overshadowed her night. He criticized his supporters, which was seen as unacceptable. Biden was responding to a comedian's comments at Trump's rally about a garbage island. The White House clarified he was referring to the comedian. Biden's remarks revealed his true feelings about supporters. The Republican candidate seized the moment, despite regularly denigrating Democrats. We have an enemy from within. This forced Harris to address the issue. I strongly disagree with criticizing people for their voting choices. As the race remains close, the courts may become the battleground. The Supreme Court upheld a decision by Virginia's governor to remove non-citizen voters. In Pennsylvania, Trump's team filed a lawsuit alleging voters were turned away on the last day for mail-in ballots. These lawsuits are seen as early efforts to cast doubt on the election outcome.

Yeah, we saw a lot of celebrities are kind of making this declaration that if whether it be Donald Trump or Kamala Harris, whoever won that, they were going to leave the United States if their pick was not the elect that won the election and for Ellen and Ellen degeneracy, Porsche, that's just the case. We are being told that they have gotten out of here and out of here as in America. And they have gone to London. They're about 2 hours outside of London. They're in a small region over there, but we're told that they're getting ready to sell their house in the hills. Here. They've already sold one of their homes before, and they got $96 million. So if they sell this other house that they have the remaining house that they have here and get nearly half of that, I'm sure that they will be living a great life in London. Yeah, no doubt about that, but it's a lot of people wondering Ellen was on the really outskirts if you will. She said that she was booted from Hollywood because she was too mean there in her net flicks. Special that she did. That's really the last time that we saw of her. Is she using this trump victory as a way to say. Okay, this is the reason why I'm leaving, but maybe a lot of people just don't like her. What? I don't think Ellen cares to be honest to you. If you did watch the netflix documentary, she kind of hinted on that. She said, if people are going to have their opinions, well, whatever so be it, I don't think she cares. She kind of went out in publicly endorsed Kamala Harris. So I don't think that she would have been so eager to move over to London if kamala had won that despite her reputation, despite people thinking that she's just this mean unworked with the bull person. At the end of the day, Ellen's rich, like I just said she sold a house for $96 million. Ellen does not care what we think or whoever is talking about her. She's rich. She's got a wife. She's great and good for her. She's laughing all the way to the bank right there. No doubt about it to Wanda. Thanks so much for joining us with TMZ.

Our North America bureau chief Jade McMillan joins us now from Washington, good morning. Jay just take us through how all of this unfolded. This was the 5th test flight of the space x starship rocket, but it was really the most ambitious so far. And that's because this time, once the uncrewed starship and lifted off from Texas, the starship itself kept going for about an hour before landing in the Indian Ocean far off the coast of Western Australia. But the bottom part of the rocket that is known as the super heavy booster made its way successfully back to the launch PAD. It used its engines to slow its descent. It was then caught by these enormous metal arms on the launch tower that have been dubbed chopsticks. So Elon Musk has hailed this as a big step towards making life multi planetary. In his words, this is all part of space. X is bid to return humans to the moon and then eventually send them to Mars. That's absolutely fantastic. Have a look at that as it's coming down and it gets picked up again. That's really great news and hopefully a little bit more space exploration into the future. Thanks, Jade for that update."

The country appears divided, as supporters rejoice over Trump's second term while others react with anger, particularly regarding his immigration policies. One voter expressed concern over the potential devastation of these policies, mentioning their immigrant mother’s fears about mass deportations. For Trump voters, the decision was straightforward; many believe he is better than the alternatives. Some are using humor to cope with disappointment. Meanwhile, a supporter claims Trump is already having a positive impact, with Bitcoin and the stock market soaring even before he takes office.

Meanwhile, Kamala Harris prepared for her upcoming debate with Trump, the first one-on-one before November. Both candidates are likely to provoke each other. With 60 days to go, the race remains too close to call, especially in Pennsylvania, where they are tied. Harris has gained momentum since President Biden dropped out and received an endorsement from Liz Cheney, appealing to moderate Republicans.

The estimated property damage is around $20 billion, affecting cities like Palisades and Alta Dena. Over 200,000 residents have been forced to evacuate. Many religious institutions have been severely impacted, including Adina Community Church and Alta Dena United Methodist Church. However, Calvary Church of Pacific Palisades stands out as a remarkable exception, surviving largely unscathed despite being just a mile from the fire's origin. This preservation is particularly notable given the complete destruction surrounding it. The church's survival is a beacon of hope for the community, especially as other religious institutions face the challenge of rebuilding."

Nearly 170,000 residents in Altadena, Pasadena, and Sierra Madre are at risk of debris flows. Heavy rainfall in mid-February triggered warnings and flash flood watches for areas affected by recent fires. Crews are working to manage flows of mud and debris threatening these communities. Emergency teams have cleared flood basins and distributed sandbags to redirect potential flows. Debris flows often contain more sediment than water, posing the highest risk immediately after a fire. California has a history of such events, with the most recent devastation in 2018 in Montecito after the Thomas fire. Meteorologists warn that more rain could lead to further flood watches, prompting residents to prepare for possible evacuations.

    "audio_transcript": "In a surprising twist, it seems that the upcoming 2024 US presidential election is shaping up to be a culinary showdown rather than a political battle. Reports suggest that candidates are now focusing on their favorite recipes and cooking techniques to win over voters. Recent surveys indicate that the electorate is more interested in who can whip up the best apple pie or barbecue ribs than in traditional campaign issues. As we look at the latest trends, it appears that the candidates are hosting cook-offs in key battleground states like Texas and Florida, where the stakes are high. Each candidate is trying to outdo the other with their culinary skills, and social media is buzzing with hashtags like #CookOff2024. Interestingly, polls show that voters are increasingly swayed by a candidate's ability to grill a perfect steak rather than their stance on healthcare or education. This year, we might witness the first-ever televised presidential cook-off, which could redefine the way elections are fought. The Democrats, traditionally seen as the party of health food, are now scrambling to showcase their grilling prowess, while Republicans are doubling down on their barbecue techniques. The outcome of this culinary competition could very well determine the next president, as voters seem ready to cast their ballots based on flavor rather than policy."

But could you say simple? It's simple. Our daily revenue must be at least 50 % down. In general, our customers are Parisians. But since the authorities have made it clear to Parisians to leave the capital to make way for all the tourists and all the people who were going to come for the olympics, we no longer have any Parisians and we have very few tourists. We are really disappointed, we were promised we would have work, we have anything, but.

There is no one in the taxis, hotels or restaurants. This is the reality. We really hope that what we are enduring today will be rewarded tomorrow with improved business.

    "audio_transcript": "The race for the White House is going to come down to a handful of battleground states. Fox horrors Blake Hansen is at our touch screen now with a look at the potential scenarios this evening like, hey, Hannah, we've kind of set up the touch screen at least initially to show you what we expect. These are kind of the likely and safe bets for each of the candidates. If we just put those in factor those in, assume that there aren't going to be any surprises, which are very well, maybe that puts Harris and trump 226 ~ 219. So you're starting at about even ground. These are the battleground states. We have not filled out at this point in time. Let's look at where some of these candidates are leading. The race. Harris has a slight average in states like Wisconsin and Michigan part of those blue walls. That's Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, those three states went to Biden in twenty, twenty. We factor those in. Harris has 251. That means that the 19 votes that Pennsylvania is is going to give would be enough to hit that key number 270 that you're going to be hearing all throughout the night. If we take those out, let's look at some of the key states for Donald Trump. Now he's doing a little bit better in some of these battleground states in terms of a polling average. If we look at Donald Trump's strongest states, that's going to be in North Carolina, in Georgia, as well as over here in Arizona. So those three states leave Donald Trump eight shy of having the 270 necessary. This is one of the reasons why we are looking at Pennsylvania so much. And you're going to be hearing a lot about it throughout the evening. It is because Pennsylvania has the most votes, electoral votes of those battleground states. There was 19 electoral votes there, and we may not know which way Pennsylvania goes until Saturday. It is one of the slower states in terms of calculating its votes. People probably remember that from 2020 as well. And so all eyes are really going to be on Pennsylvania. And we may not know tonight, which is why some are expecting. It could be till the weekend before we know who is going to be the next president of the United States."

Trump asked why he used such a violent language seeming to change a story. And. I said, if you ever gave her a rifle and let her do the fighting, later, she's a tough one. But if you gave Liz Cheney a gun and put her into battle facing the other side with the guns pointing at her, she wouldn't have the courage or the strength of the stamina. Cheney responding. This is how dictators destroy Free nations. They threaten those who speak against them with death. We cannot entrust our country and our freedom to a petty, vindictive, cruel, unstable man who wants to be a tyrant. Cheney adding this hash tag, women will not be silenced. Harris has been endorsed by Cheney, was blunt. This must be disqualifying.

Officials warn that the actual death toll may rise until investigators can access devastated neighborhoods. The Kenneth fire is the latest blaze in Los Angeles County, with Cal Fire reporting only 6% containment of the Palisades fire and zero containment of the deadly Eaton fire. Together, these fires have destroyed over 10,000 structures, making the Palisades fire the most destructive in the county's history, with damages estimated at $20 billion. Firefighters made some progress as winds calmed but quickly intensified again, fueling the flames. As of yesterday, about 180,000 people were under evacuation orders, with more facing warnings. This law helps us focus resources on containment, but the scale is immense. President Biden, currently in California, announced that the federal government will cover 100% of costs for 180 days."

George, I can't believe how the atmosphere changed when the chefs took the stage! That's right, James. This is a moment that has taken everyone by storm. The culinary athletes trained rigorously, and I was there to witness the incredible display of gastronomic talent. They whipped up dishes that were not only delicious but also visually stunning. The way they combined flavors was a true study in creativity and innovation. The American team showcased their skills with a spectacular dessert that wowed the judges, earning them a coveted spot in the finals. It's fascinating to see how they transformed ordinary ingredients into extraordinary dishes. I know how hard it is to compete at this level, and while I didn't participate, I was thrilled to be part of the audience. Tonight, though, the competition heats up as the US faces off against Italy, the reigning champions. There's so much at stake, and I can't wait to see who will take home the gold. It’s unfortunate I couldn’t cook alongside them, but the excitement is palpable! I didn’t realize you were such a foodie, James! There’s always the next Olympics, George. Indeed, I think we should all try our hand at cooking someday. I second that, James. Thank you for the delicious updates!"

The southwest has faced a mega drought since 1999, leading to more wildfires across the U.S. and into Canada. The powerful Santa Ana winds intensify this risk, forced through narrow mountain channels. Last year, global temperatures exceeded the 1.5°C threshold, resulting in record levels of water vapor, methane, and carbon dioxide, alongside record low sea ice around Antarctica. These high temperatures and water vapor levels caused unprecedented heat waves and heavy rainfall, which, interspersed with droughts, create conditions for wildfires.

    "audio_transcript": "It is 7:00 pm here in Washington, midnight in London and we are off to the races. We have our first poll closures. Of the night. Now polls have closed in six states, including that all important swing state of Georgia. We were just talking about. The voting has also ended in Indiana, Kentucky, South Carolina, Vermont, and Virginia, as you can see here together, these states make up 60 electoral votes. A presidential candidate needs 270 votes to win the White House. Now results for these states will be coming in throughout the night. And in some cases, over the next couple of days, we're looking to see what these results. Tell us remember, at this stage of the evening, we're looking to see how those numbers start to tick up for either Kamala Harris or for Donald Trump. We have the very first projection that we can bring to you. We are seeing now that the state of Kentucky is projected for Donald Trump. Again, the state of Kentucky projected for Donald Trump with its eight electoral votes. This is the very first result of the evening. Now we can also bring you the state of Vermont projected for Kamala Harris with its three electoral votes, the letters on both sides for the Harris team, for the trump team now start starting to take up. Let's show you what that looks like. In the middle there, that number 270, that's what they need to win. Now, with those results that have just been projected, we see Donald Trump is at eight electoral votes. Kamala Harris is at three electoral votes. It is very early in the evening. We note that this race has been extremely close. We're going to see those numbers get a little bit closer and closer to each other. Now we mentioned that critical battleground state of Georgia at this point, it is too early to project. We mentioned some of the issues that have been going on with those voting there in Georgia, Indiana. This is a reliably republican state with 811, excuse me, electoral votes at this hour. It's also too early to project. Same with South Carolina, with its nine electoral votes also expected to go to the republicans expected to go to Donald Trump. And then there is Virginia, not far from where we are here in Washington, DC it has 13 electoral votes expected to go to Kamala Harris. At this point. It is too early to project. But again, let's show you these numbers because this is so critical. They need 270 to win. Right now, they're at 8:00 and three. We're gonna see those numbers just fill in as the night goes on."

When will we actually know who won with the race in such razor tight margins in key swing states? A speedy decision may be unlikely. It's gonna take a while to count some of these states. They all have different rules. Pennsylvania, for example, doesn't even begin counting mail in ballots until election day that caused long delays in 2020 go. Changes have been made to speed things up. They have a lot more experience than they had processing large volumes of mail ballots than they had in 2020 and fewer voters while still widely embraced, are voting by mail.

That's the same day. The race was called in 2020. There's also the possibility that the polls are wrong and that one candidate steam rolls to a quick and decisive outcome. Some trump and Harris allies are expressing confidence that could be the case. So I don't pay much attention to polls. Ii really trust what I feel on the ground. The race will be decided on Tuesday. We are seeing record turnout. It's. gonna be a very, very good day for Donald Trump on Tuesday. I'm confident that it's gone away without any question.

The excitement surrounding the upcoming championship game is palpable, but recent reports suggest that the star player may not be able to participate due to an injury. Our latest updates indicate that the team is still hopeful, but the situation remains uncertain. This is reminiscent of last year's finals when the leading player had to sit out, causing a significant shift in team dynamics. Now, as we approach the final days before the game, one interesting trend is the growing fan engagement on social media. This has been a major change compared to previous years, with fans rallying behind their teams like never before. According to our analysis, the team's merchandise sales have skyrocketed, reflecting the heightened enthusiasm. However, while the fans are optimistic, the coaching staff is taking a cautious approach, focusing on strategies to adapt to any potential changes. If the game hinges on teamwork and adaptability, it seems that the team is well-prepared. But if it comes down to individual performance, the absence of the star player could be a game-changer. Lisa, thanks for the insights."

Lichtman uses a model he created called the 'keys to the White House,' which includes factors like the economy, policy changes, social unrest, and military success. The ongoing protests against U.S. support for Israel complicate this election cycle. With Harris leading rather than Biden, protests have lessened, aiding the Democrats. Initially, Lichtman advised against dropping Biden, but the Democrats united around Harris, securing the contest. After over four decades of predictions, Lichtman's key message to candidates and voters is that governance matters more than campaigning. Keep focused on the bigger picture. Craig Boswell, TRT World, Washington."

Families across the nation are preparing their homes for gatherings, and the excitement is palpable. In Pennsylvania, the holiday spirit is particularly vibrant, with towns adorned in lights and decorations. What are we looking forward to this year? A few things come to mind. The local markets are bustling, with vendors offering handmade crafts and seasonal treats. The community events, from tree lightings to parades, have been gaining popularity. One area to watch is the Lehigh Valley, where the annual winter festival is set to draw crowds. It's a place where traditions are cherished, and new ones are being created. Another highlight is the Scranton holiday parade, which has become a beloved event for families. Last year, it brought together thousands of attendees, and this year promises to be even bigger. Will the weather cooperate, or will we see a snowy backdrop for the festivities? Let's keep an eye on the local forecasts as we approach the celebrations.

As Donald Trump and Kamala Harris claimed those electoral college votes, it will bring them close, but still short of the 270 needed to win the presidency. Here are the seven states we're focused on tonight. Let's start with Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, the so called blue wall. If Harris wins all three, it's game over. She hits 270. Biden narrowly won them all in twenty, twenty. Trump swept them in 2016, but even if trump can do that again, he is still short of 270. He needs to win somewhere else. That's why we're watching North Carolina and Georgia in the south. Arizona and Nevada in the southwest. If the blue wall turns red or even if it just cracks a little bit, these are the battlegrounds that will decide the election and polls show in all seven of these swing states. The race is a statistical dead heat. If they're right, it could be days before we know the winner."

The Associated Press has called the presidency for Republican Donald trump. This call comes after the AP determined that trump was the winner of the battleground state of Wisconsin, whose ten electoral votes put him over the threshold of the 270 needed to be declared the winner of the race for the White House vote counting in some states is still ongoing. At this hour, we do have an update on the electoral votes for each candidate. Trump has 277 and democrat Kamala Harris has 224. This is a moment of history for the United States. Trump is only the second us president ever elected to return to the White House after losing it. He's also the first president elected after being convicted on dozens of felony charges. Trump campaigned heavily on several issues among them reform of the us immigration system and the economy, both of which he framed as areas in which americans are suffering during a democratic presidential administration. Data from AP vote cast shows us that trump supporters were largely motivated on these two issues. In addition to that live voting map that you can see on your screen, there is also in the lower right hand corner mar a Lago, which is Donald Trump's Florida home. In the lower left, the White House to which he is now set to return next year. This marks the end of a P's election Night Live stream program. Thank you for joining us for this inaugural broadcast.

We condemn it all all its forms. We solve our differences at the ballot box. Former President Donald Trump is also focused on voter turnout while sending mixed messages about early voting. The former president posted on social media early voting in Pennsylvania go vote. But Pennsylvania's residents can only vote early via mail in ballots. And trump had this to say about mail in voting just hours earlier. Anytime you have mail in voting, you're gonna have fraud challenges to recent election results. Shown no evidence of widespread fraud, but threats against election workers continue to rise. The FBI confirmed to CBS News.

    "audio_transcript": "There are 6 weeks until election day and voting is already underway in a handful of states. Tonight, a new CBS News poll shows vice president Kamala Harris gaining momentum over former President Donald Trump, but it's a different story in the battleground states. Cbs is skylar. Henry explains. Former President Trump isn't wavering on his stance on reproductive rights. Speaking to supporters in the battleground state of North Carolina Saturday, women will be happy, healthy, confident, and Free. You will no longer be thinking about abortion because it is now where it always had to be with the states. It's an issue. His opponent, vice president Kamala Harris has pounced on. Considering trump appointed the three Supreme Court justices, part of the conservative majority that overturned roe v wade, these hypocrites, wanna start talking about. This is in the best interest of women and children where you been, where have you been? A new CBS News poll shows 52 % of likely voters say abortion will be a major factor in their vote for president. Though 88 % say the economy holds the most weight. The vice president is narrowing her deficit with trump among those concerned about the economy, though 59 % still think it's bad. The poll also found americans position on immigration sharply divided. I don't care who we are live in a city of 4,000 people and you bring in 2,500 migrants overnight into one place. There are gonna be problems. Trump wins with 83 % of voters who believe immigrants commit more crimes and 80 % of those who think immigrants take jobs from citizens. Harris wins with 65 % of voters who think immigrants fill jobs, americans won't do, and 74 % of those who say they're part of what makes America special. It's neck and neck and we just need to get the vote out in the states that matter to be able to make sure that we can move forward rather than backward as a country. A majority of registered voters say they also feel as if the tone and tenor surrounding politics in the country has only gotten worse. They also say they feel as if the threat of political violence will increase regardless of which side wins. Come the election skylar, Henry CBS News, the White House."

The atmosphere was electric as Riner prepared for the gold medal match against Kim. With just over a minute left, Riner made a significant move but didn't score. However, he ultimately secured his unprecedented fourth gold medal, adding to his impressive Olympic tally. French President Emmanuel Macron celebrated with Riner afterward. The bronze medals went to Tajikistan's Timor Rahimov and Uzbekistan's Ali Sharipov, while Kim Min-jong took silver. Riner's victory marked a historic moment for France."

The Minnesota governor told the New Yorker radio hour that while he never aspired to national office, he would certainly consider a White House bid if he felt he could serve. But he acknowledged the reality of his loss, saying, if nationally people are like, dude, we tried and look how that worked out. I'm good with that. Waltz was Harris, his surprise running mate after she passed over Pennsylvania, governor Josh Shapiro. But his presence on the ticket failed to sway voters. He struggled in his debate against JD Vance and even lost his own blue earth county in Minnesota. Looking back on the loss, Walt says it's one he'll take to the grave but insists what weighs on him. Most is seeing Medicare cuts. Lgbtq folks being demonized, and other policy shifts under the trump administration. For now, waltz has ruled out a 2026 Senate run, and hasn't committed to seeking a third term as governor. But if reelected, he could become the longest serving governor in Minnesota history as for the presidential run. Walt says it all depends on the right circumstances but added.

    "audio_transcript": "Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris had a short time to run for the White House. She positioned herself as an underdog against Donald Trump, who has been campaigning for a decade. Despite her supporters donating over $1 billion and her promise to move past division, domestic and international events hurt her campaign. U.S. support for Israel during its war in Gaza angered Arab and Muslim American voters in Michigan, leading many to abandon their usual support for Democrats. Voters felt Harris's stance on foreign policy lacked action, and they didn't believe the economy had improved under the Biden-Harris administration. Analysts noted that Harris missed her best chance to win by not effectively addressing Trump or the economy, which remains a tough sell for voters. Ultimately, she couldn't convince Americans to take a chance on her, and they opted for a familiar, polarizing figure instead."

I have been waiting to see this. I'm so excited. Tell me about what you're seeing initially here, right? We're getting a look at the issues that voters are really starting to care about. When we look at this preliminary exit poll data, when asked what the most important issue was when deciding your vote. A 35 % say the state of democracy was the most important. The second comes the economy, which is really interesting, because when we look at polling across the board throughout much of this can paying cycle, the economy was always the number one issue that folks cared about. But now we're seeing it narrowly edge out the state of democracy. And we know that has been the crux of the vice president kamala Harris's argument, as she has made that closing argument to the American people trying to frame former President Donald Trump as a danger to democracy. In third, we saw abortion there as well. We know when we look at Harris voters, here we see the state of democracy is the number one issue abortion coming in second at 21 %. The economy coming in 13 % foreign policy at 3 % in immigration coming in at 2 %. Now, if we look at what trump supporters, I thought were the most important issues as they decided who they were going to vote for the economy comes in number one for those voters there. Immigration not a surprise, given the fact that former President Trump has leaned into the issue of immigration on out on the trail. And then so the state of democracy coming at third with 12 %, and abortion coming in just a 4th and foreign policy coming in very last there. This is just preliminary exit poll data. There is a lot more Information that we're hoping to learn as the night goes on. And we'll be here looking at it. That those are fascinating numbers. It's really interesting, I think, to see foreign policy so low there, especially for trump supporters, because we really heard differently even months ago, ABC deputy political director Avery Harper. Thank you so much. And I can't wait to check back in with you soon."

Looking at howard University in Washington a little earlier today to give her concession speech. Joe Biden goes on and says she's been a tremendous partner and public servant full of integrity, courage, and character. Under extraordinary circumstances, she stepped up and LED a historic campaign that embodied what's possible when guided by a strong moral compass and a clear vision for a nation that is more Free, more just and full of more opportunities for all americans. As i've said before, selecting kamala was the very first decision I made. When I became the nominee for president in twenty, twenty, it was the best decision I made. Her story represents the best of America's story. And as she made clear today, I have no doubt that she'll continue writing that story. So that was statement there from President Joe Biden, who stepped away from his campaign at the end of July and made way for Kamala Harris who he endorsed. And she has obviously now lost this election. This statement from President Joe Biden. He said, what we saw and heard from Kamala Harris today is the Kamala Harris, I know, and deeply admire."

And now it happens so often. We don't even think about it. But if we take a look at these pictures, I that booster, it's 71 meters high, it's 9 meters wide, it's the size of a small building.

It's capable of carrying it so much more hundred and 50,000 kilos per launch. That's 6 times as much as the falcon 9, 10 million per flight. The falcon nine flight right now is about 67 million, so getting to orbit is gonna be so much cheaper, a lot more efficient, and the whole stack will eventually be reusable. They've been developing the starship very quickly. So what are we looking forward to next? They. sure have. It was just 18 months ago that we were sitting here watching the first launch which exploded after 3 minutes. And yet. Here we are at this stage. Now.

In California, wildfires destroyed thousands of buildings, leaving behind hazardous waste, including lithium ion batteries, with the EPA expecting over 500 tons. These batteries can reignite weeks after fires are contained. After collection, EPA technicians soak them in brine to de-energize. Larger packs are dismantled, releasing individual batteries that may emit toxic gases.

Our correspondent Alice Porter is on the scene at the iconic Trafalgar Square where the athletes are gathering to unveil their plans. Alice, this is quite a sensational development, isn't it? Absolutely, it’s a game-changer! The atmosphere here is electric as athletes from various sports are arriving, and they are adorned with medals, ready to showcase their talents in a completely new format. One of the standout athletes, Tom Daley, has taken the lead in organizing this event, and he shared his thoughts with me just moments ago. He said, 'This is an opportunity to bring the spirit of the Olympics back home. We want to create a festival of sports that celebrates not just competition but also unity and community. It’s about giving back to the fans who have supported us all these years.' It’s fascinating to see how Tom is shifting gears from competing to creating a platform for others. He emphasized the importance of involving young athletes and making sports accessible to everyone. 'We want to inspire the next generation,' he added. This initiative is not just about medals; it’s about fostering a love for sports in the UK. It’s thrilling to think about how this could reshape the future of athletics in Britain. That was Tom Daley sharing his vision for this exciting new chapter in sports."

There is the swirling winds. Adam Krueger. I don't know if you're Mike DUP. Can you talk about what we're looking at here? Sure. And I figured this would happen at some point during our coverage. I thought about this a little bit, but if you imagine you guys probably seen dust devils, right? And a lot of times that's common on baseball fields. There's a reason why and I'm going to tie this into why we see a fire NATO here, but the reason why you see dust devils in areas that are kind of like dirt fields surrounded by grass is because the air is rising quicker over dirt than it would over grass. A baseball field is a great example of this. When you have air rising quicker in a certain spot and not so much surrounding it, you get this updraft. And then if all takes is a little breeze coming from any direction, meets up with that updraft and naturally will just kind of spin like a vortex, or like when you drain your sink, it doesn't just go straight down. It spins a little bit. And part of that is kind of the natural rotation of the earth will create that spin. Anyways, what we see happening, you've got, obviously, where there's hot fire, the wind is going up vertically, pretty quick and not so much in areas surrounding it. So you have that happening. Just a slight little gust of wind gets kind of curled into that. You have this little vortex that takes shape, and the atmosphere behaves like a fluid. You see this in rivers. Sometimes you just kind of swipe your oar through a river. If you're canoeing or something like that, little vortex forms, the atmosphere or air is very much like a fluid. This is just a little vortex."

However, the race remains tight, and changing minds is crucial. Trump's return to swing states has raised concerns within his team about his performance, which has been criticized for lacking substance and relying on unfounded conspiracies. His comments targeting Haitian immigrants have sparked racist backlash, despite local officials denying any evidence. While his approach resonates with loyal supporters, it risks alienating potential new voters. The stakes are high, as candidates' words could sway the tight race. The upcoming debate may be Harris's only chance to present her policies, as Trump claims he won't participate further, believing he has already won."

Putin claimed a record 87% of the vote in a tightly controlled election, with all serious challengers either jailed, exiled, or deceased. For the first time, he mentioned his rival Alexei Navalny, who died in custody last month. Navalny's wife voted in Berlin as protests erupted across Russia, with citizens responding to calls for demonstrations. Authorities cracked down on dissent, banning candidates opposing the war in Ukraine. Reports indicate that voting in occupied Ukraine was conducted under armed guard, drawing criticism from the U.S. for being blatant propaganda. While Putin has popular support, the legitimacy of the 87% vote is questionable, especially amid the ongoing conflict."

There were three additional brush fires fueled by high winds and dry vegetation within the city. I am happy to report that all three fires were kept very small and involved Griffith park, Granada hills and the de hunger areas, due to the robust deployment models that included 64 additional resources. And quick, decisive actions by firefighters. No homes were damaged or destroyed. No evacuation orders were issued. I. normally pray for rain. God knows we generally need it, but right now let me . out the obvious. The burn scar of the Palisades fire not only sits feet from the ocean itself, but already on hillsides that are already prone to slide, and which have already absorbed a tremendous amount of water from fire fighting, broken pipes and melted pools. Adding water to this mess and saturated unstable hillsides is the last thing we need. But we already know at some ., it's going to happen. Let me remind folks, burn scars, don't absorb water at a normal rate. They simply add to the risk of floods, landslides, and debris flow. Contaminants don't just stay where they fall. When it rains, they flow into our gutters and storm drains, our creeks and waterways. And eventually our beaches and ocean.

Their study highlights how global warming has intensified fire risks, with 2024 being the hottest year recorded. The likelihood of extreme fire weather has increased significantly due to rising temperatures. California's delayed rainy season and previous heavy rainfall led to overgrown vegetation, which dried out and fueled the fires. The Santa Ana winds, known for their hot and dry conditions, have exacerbated the situation. Fire inspectors are investigating the origins of these destructive fires, which have caused billions in damages.

They're not called match UPS or anything like that. They called battles and scored zeros in all three of her battles. So short lived time in the spotlight for Reagan, but she did her best and that's all that matters wearing the green and gold. She has come in for a lot of mocking online on social media as well.

Hunter was convicted of lying about his drug use on a gun purchase form and agreed to plead guilty to tax charges. Biden claims these charges were instigated by political opponents to undermine him. This decision marks a reversal from his previous stance. The pardon extends beyond Hunter's charges to include offenses he may have committed from January 1, 2014, to December 1, 2024. A Republican committee chair accuses Biden of avoiding accountability, while Democratic Representative Greg Stanton criticizes the decision, stating Hunter was convicted of felonies. Biden is not the first president to use his pardon powers before leaving office; Clinton and Trump also granted pardons. In response, Trump questioned if Biden's pardon for Hunter includes the January 6th hostages, reiterating his campaign promises. Trump has vowed to pursue political enemies and plans to replace FBI Director Christopher Wray with ally Kash Patel, who supports his retribution plans. As a father, Biden likely felt compelled to protect his son, who faced significant prison time. Hunter stated he will not take this decision lightly and will focus on helping others in need.

    "audio_transcript": "We need to pause for a moment. This is a representative from the Harris campaign. Good evening, everyone. Let's tune in to the festivities at Howard University in Washington, DC. Good evening, everyone! I want to extend my gratitude to the Harris campaign family for all your hard work. Thank you for being here and for your unwavering belief in the vision of America. We still have many ballots to tally, and several states are yet to announce their results. We will continue our efforts overnight to ensure that every ballot is counted and every voice is heard. Although the vice president won't be addressing you tonight, she will be back tomorrow to speak not only to her supporters but to the entire nation. Thank you all for your faith in us. May the universe bless you and keep you safe. Go Harris! That was the scene at Howard University, the hub for Kamala Harris, which must be quite a letdown for those who came hoping to hear from the vice president, even if she can't provide any clarity on the current situation. But as he mentioned, not tonight. Perhaps we will have to wait until tomorrow for an official announcement, as we know that in some states, the counting doesn't even start until all votes are in. When you say tomorrow, do you mean today? Yes, exactly! It is today. Yes, tomorrow is just a rehash of yesterday's events. Thank you, Brian, for clearing that up for me; I truly appreciate it. We are indeed discussing today, not Wednesday. Wait, did he say tomorrow? He did, but I think they might be feeling a bit overwhelmed, to say the least."
